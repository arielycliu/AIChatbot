SWAT,"Negotiator on site. Repeat, negotiator on site."
Caroline Phillips,"No, stop… I… I… I can't leave her. Oh, oh please, please, you gotta save my little girl... Wait… you’re sending an android?"
SWAT,"Alright, ma’am. We need to go."
Caroline Phillips,You can’t… you can't do that! You W- Why aren't you sending a real person? Don't let that thing near her! Keep that thing away from my daughter! KEEP IT AWAY!
Allen,Why are we wasting time sending an android to negotiate?! That piece of crap could jump from the rooftop any second. I DON’T GIVE A SHIT! My men are ready to step in... just give the order! Fuck! I don’t believe this…
Connor,Captain Allen? My name is Connor. I’m the android sent by CyberLife.
Allen,"It’s firing at everything that moves, it already shot down two of my men... We could easily get it, but they’re on the edge of the balcony. If it falls, she falls."
Connor,Do you know its name?
Allen,I haven’t got a clue. Does it matter?
Connor,I need information to determine the best approach.
Connor,Do you know if it’s been behaving strangely before this?
Allen,I haven’t got a clue. Does it matter?
Connor,I need information to determine the best approach.
Connor,Has it experienced an emotional shock recently?
Allen,I haven’t got a clue. Does it matter?
Connor,I need information to determine the best approach.
Connor,Have you tried its deactivation code?
Allen,It's the first thing we tried.
Allen,"Listen, saving that kid is all that matters. So either you deal with this fucking android now, or I’ll take care of it."
Emma,"This is Daniel, the coolest android in the world! Say hi, Daniel!"
Daniel,Hello.
Emma,You’re my bestie! We’ll always be together!
Allen,"All units, hold positions. The negotiator’s going in."
SWAT,In position. Ready to assault.
Tablet,Your order for an AP700 android has been registered. CyberLife thanks you for your purchase.
Daniel,Go away! All of you go away - or I’ll jump!
Allen,Stay sharp. I want everybody ready to go at any second.
Daniel,Leave us alone! I want all of you out of here now!
Allen,Get the paramedics ready. I've got a man down and another one wounded on the balcony. We have to evacuate him ASAP.
Daniel,Get out of here! You have to go!
Allen,Hold positions. I repeat: hold positions.
Allen,"Man down! I repeat, man down! Requesting immediate evac!"
SWAT,In position. Ready to assault.
SWAT,That cop is alive... I saw his leg move…
SWAT,Get out of the fucking way!
SWAT,What are you looking at?! Don’t stand there!
Daniel,"I’ll jump. I swear, I’ll do it!"
Allen,"Fuck, we gotta do something or that bastard is gonna jump off with the kid…"
Daniel,What are you doing here? There’s NOTHING you can do!
Allen,Get those TV assholes out of here! I only wanna see our choppers in the area!
ITM TV,"It’s been just over an hour since a little girl was taken hostage on the top floor of a building here in downtown Detroit. Details are still emerging on what exactly happened, but the hostage taker could be the family’s android. He may have taken the lives of at least one family member and a police officer… If confirmed, this would be the first case of an android deliberately taking human lives. By all signs, the SWAT team are preparing for an assault and-"
Allen,What the fuck are you doing? You gonna talk to it or what?
Daniel,Stay back! Don’t come any closer or I’ll jump!
Emma,"No! No, please! I’m begging you!"
SWAT,"Go, go, go!"
Connor,"Hi, Daniel."
Daniel,How…
Connor,My name is Connor.
Daniel,How do you know my name?
Connor,I know a lot of things about you. I’ve come to get you out of this.
Connor,My name is Connor. What about you? What is your name?
Daniel,Daniel... That’s the name they gave me. Stay back!
Connor,"I know you’re angry, Daniel. But you need to trust me and let me help you."
Daniel,I don’t want your help! Nobody can help me! All I want is for all this to stop… I... I just want all this to stop...
Connor,"I want you to let Emma go. She's just a little girl, she has nothing to do with this."
Daniel,"No way! You’ll shoot me the second she’s free. But I’m not that stupid! No, I am not that stupid…"
Connor,I’m not going to hurt you. I just want to talk and find a solution.
Daniel,Talk? I don’t wanna talk. It’s too late for that now. It's too late…
Connor,"I’m an android, just like you. I know how you’re feeling."
Daniel,What difference does it make if you’re an android? You’re on their side! You can’t understand how I’m feeling!
Cop,Please… Please help me…
Connor,"He's losing blood. If we don't get him to a hospital, he's going to die."
Daniel,All humans die eventually. What does it matter if this one dies now?
Connor,I’m going to apply a tourniquet.
Daniel,Don’t touch him! Touch him and I kill you!
Connor,You can’t kill me. I’m not alive.
Connor,Okay.
Daniel,Are you armed?
Connor,"No, I don't have a gun."
Daniel,You’re lying! I know you have a gun!
Connor,"I’m telling you the truth, Daniel. I came here unarmed."
Connor,Yes. I have a gun.
Daniel,"Drop it! No sudden moves, or I’ll shoot!"
Connor,"There, no more gun."
Connor,"They were going to replace you and you became upset. That’s what happened, right?"
Daniel,"I thought I was part of the family. I thought I mattered… But I was just their toy, something to throw away when you’re done with it…"
Connor,I know you and Emma were very close. You think she betrayed you - but she’s done nothing wrong.
Daniel,She lied to me... I thought she loved me... but I was wrong… She’s just like all the other humans…
Emma,"Daniel, no..."
Connor,"There's no way out, Daniel. What you’ve done is too serious. The only question is whether or not you take another innocent life."
Daniel,"It’s not up to you - I’m holding all the cards! If I die, she dies. You hear me?!"
Connor,"Look what you did! You're designed to serve humans, not kill them!"
Daniel,What was I designed to be? Their slave? Their toy? I just wanted them to care about me... I just wanted to matter… I just wanted to be someone…
Connor,"Listen, I know it’s not your fault. These emotions you’re feeling are just errors in your software."
Daniel,"No, it's not my fault… I never wanted this... I loved them, you know… but I was nothing to them… just a slave to be ordered around..."
Connor,"You’re defective, Daniel. There's a problem with your software. We're going to fix you and everything will be okay."
Daniel,I don’t need to be fixed! I’m working perfectly! But my eyes are open now… I will never let anyone humiliate me again… Ever!
Connor,"Are you okay, Emma?"
Emma,Please help me... I don’t wanna die! I don’t wanna die…
Connor,Nobody’s going to die. Stay calm. Everything’s going to be fine.
Daniel,Urgggh… I can’t stand that noise anymore! Tell that helicopter to get out of here!
SWAT,The situation is under control.
Connor,"There, I did what you wanted."
Connor,I don’t think they’d listen to me.
Connor,"I’m your last chance, Daniel. If you let it slip, they’ll kill you. Let the hostage go, you have no other choice."
Connor,"You have to trust me, Daniel. Let the hostage go and I promise you everything will be fine."
Connor,"You don’t really wanna jump, Daniel. Or you would've done it already. Now, hand me the gun and this will all be over."
Daniel,Don’t come any closer! Come any closer and I swear I’ll jump!
Connor,"Okay… Look, I'll stay right here."
Connor,"Listen, there are snipers on every roof. Let the hostage go. You have no other choice."
Daniel,"I want everyone to leave… And I wanna car! When I’m outside the city, I’ll let her go!"
Connor,"What now, Daniel? Is this really what you want?"
Daniel,You lied to me! You lied to me!!!
Connor,"It’s up to you how the story ends. Make the right choice, Daniel."
Daniel,"I didn't want this... no, you left me no choice… No choice…"
Connor,"That’s impossible, Daniel. Let the girl go and I promise you won’t be hurt."
Connor,"That’s out of the question. You’re a machine, you have to obey. Now put the gun down and let the hostage go."
Daniel,I don’t wanna die…
Connor,You’re not going to die. We're just going to talk. Nothing will happen to you. You have my word.
Connor,You took human lives. Nothing can stop them from destroying you now. But taking one more life won’t do you any good.
Daniel,Okay... I trust you…
Daniel,"You lied to me, Connor. You lied to me…"
Daniel,I’ve spent my life taking orders. Now it’s my turn to decide.
Connor,"Hello, Amanda."
Amanda,Connor… It’s good to see you.
Amanda,I expected you to find the deviant who killed that man… I must admit I'm a little bit disappointed...
Connor,I'm sorry. I know I should have succeeded.
Amanda,Nevermind. I’m sure you’ll show more foresight in the future.
Amanda,"Congratulations, Connor... Finding that deviant was far from easy, and the way you interrogated it was very clever. You’ve been remarkably efficient, Connor."
Connor,"Thank you, Amanda."
Amanda,We’ve asked the DPD to transfer it to us for further study. It may teach us something about what happened.
Amanda,"Your predecessor was unfortunately destroyed... It knew deviants could be unpredictable, but it wasn’t careful enough… I hope you won’t make the same mistake."
Connor,I don't intend to.
Amanda,"When a Connor model is destroyed, its memory is transferred to the next one, but some data can be lost in the process. Avoid being destroyed. It will be better for you and the investigation…"
Connor,I understand.
Amanda,Finding that deviant was far from easy… you showed great skill in your investigation. But you knew deviants could be unstable. You should have been more cautious.
Connor,I thought I could make it talk… It was a judgement error.
Amanda,Nevermind. I’m sure you’ll be more careful in future.
Amanda,The interrogation seemed… challenging… What did you think of the deviant?
Connor,"It showed signs of PTSD after being abused by its owner, as if its original program had been completely replaced by new instructions."
Connor,"It showed all the signs of deviancy: cognitive instability, unpredictable behavior, and the emulation of human emotions. It was even afraid to die. The model was clearly defective."
Connor,"I prevented it from being damaged, so we might still learn something by analyzing it."
Connor,It said something to me: “The truth is inside”. I don’t know what that means… unless it was just another error in its program.
Connor,It could've killed everyone in the room. The previous Connor should have anticipated the danger. It was a mistake to let an armed policeman so close to the deviant.
Connor,"It simulated human emotion, fear in particular, in a very convincing way. It seemed completely overwhelmed by them, and behaved irrationally,"
Amanda,This… Lieutenant Anderson has been officially assigned to the deviancy case… What do you make of him?
Connor,"I find him unpleasant and unprofessional. He seems to have an addictive personality, has a lack of respect for procedure, and despises androids - which makes our relationship difficult."
Connor,I would define him as “dysfunctional”. He obviously has a personal situation impacting his professional behavior and... seems to have no interest in the investigation.
Connor,"I think he’s irritable, and socially challenged. But I also think he used to be a good detective… He’s an intriguing character."
Connor,"He’s obviously not what I was expecting, but... I don’t have enough information yet to form a definitive opinion."
Amanda,"Unfortunately, we have no choice but to work with him… What do you think is the best approach?"
Connor,"I will try to establish a friendly relationship. If I can get him to trust me, it will be helpful for the investigation."
Connor,I will adapt to his personality. It is in the best interest of the investigation that I avoid conflict and try to accommodate his psychology.
Connor,"I will focus on the investigation and try to ignore him. As long as he doesn’t interfere and we avoid conflict, he shouldn’t be a problem."
Connor,I don’t have enough data to decide that yet. I’ll learn more about him and try to adapt my behavior accordingly.
Amanda,"More and more androids show signs of deviancy. There are millions in circulation. If they become unstable, the consequences will be disastrous. You are the most advanced prototype CyberLife has ever created. If anyone can figure out what’s happening, it's you."
Connor,"You can count on me, Amanda."
Amanda,"Pick up the investigation where the previous Connor left off, and put a stop to this."
Amanda,Continue your investigation and put a stop to this.
Amanda,"Hurry, Connor. There’s little time."
Woman,"I’m getting nervous, Mark."
Man,"It’s okay… It's okay, just relax… Just tell 'em what happened to you."
Woman,But it was all over so quickly... I didn’t even see his face!
Man,Any little detail might help them catch the guy… you never know.
Woman,"You might be in shock, just… Just take it easy."
Man,"Yeah… Would you mind getting me some water, please?"
Woman,Sure. There you go.
Man,Thanks… I needed that.
Woman,It shouldn't be too long now.
CTN TV,"Tensions in the Arctic have reached a new level, with a Russian carrier and an American patrol boat reported to have clashed last night. Several warning shots were exchanged, apparently with no damage or casualties to either side. The Minister for Defense, Denis Riggs, has spoken of ""intolerable provocation that cannot go unanswered"". The countries in the region, particularly Sweden and Canada, have called for military forces to withdraw and an international conference to be held. So far, there has been no response from either Moscow or Washington. We’ll keep you informed minute by minute as the situation develops."
Android,Can I help you?
Connor,I’m here to see Lieutenant Anderson.
Android,Do you have authorization?
Connor,Yes.
Android,"Lieutenant Anderson hasn't arrived yet, but you can wait at his desk."
Ben,No shit? That fucking machine could have killed everyone in the room…
Connor,I'm looking for Lieutenant Anderson's desk.
Android,It's that desk right there.
Guy,"What?.. What are you lookin' at?.. Hey, fuck you! Fuckin' android…"
Deviant,They're gonna destroy me…
Connor,It’s probable. They have to analyze your biocomponents. They need to understand what happened.
Connor,My objective was to capture you alive. What happens now is not my problem.
Connor,I'm sorry. It's not what I wanted… but there's nothing I can do.
Connor,You're only a machine. It doesn't matter.
Connor,"I know there’s something you didn’t tell me. I need to know, before they take you away…"
Connor,The sculpture you made… Tell me more about it…
Connor,"What you said yesterday… ""the truth is inside""… What does it mean?"
Connor,What you wrote on the wall... rA9… What does it mean?
Connor,Do you know any other deviants? Are there many of you?
Deviant,I'm going to die…
Ben,"Open the cell, quick! Hurry! I'll call CyberLife… Clean this mess up…"
Gavin,"Shit... Look at that… a fucking ghost… His clone ends up in a dumpster, but this morning, what do you know?! Another son of a bitch takes his place…"
Gavin,"Fuck, look at that… Our friend the plastic detective is back in town! Congratulations on last night, very impressive!"
Gavin,Could've got something outta that android if you haven't fucked it up...
Gavin,"Look at that! It seems Hank has a new partner! Fucking plastic detective! Hey! You his drinking buddy? You bring him home when he's too drunk to find his car? Ha, he stinks of booze!"
Connor,"Hello, Detective Reed."
Connor,Hello. My name is Connor.
Gavin,Never seen an android like you before… What model are you?
Connor,RK800. I'm a prototype.
Gavin,A prototype? Android detective… So machines are gonna… replace us all… is that it?..
Connor,"I'm sorry, but I'm not authorized to answer you. If you have any questions, please contact your superior."
Gavin,"Hey, asshole, I’m talkin' to you!"
Gavin,"Hey, bring me a coffee, dipshit! GET A MOVE ON!"
Gavin,"Do yourself a favor, stay outta my way."
Connor,"I'm sorry, but I only take orders from Lieutenant Anderson."
Gavin,Oh… Oh…
Gavin,"If Hank hadn’t got in the way yesterday, I would’ve fucked you up for disobeying a human. Stay outta my way… 'Cause next time... you won’t get off so easy."
Gavin,"When a human gives you an order, you obey. Got it? Stay outta my way… Next time, you won’t get off so easy."
Gavin,I gave you an order!
CTN TV,"Several sources report that CyberLife has provided Detroit Police with a prototype detective android. Although police assistant androids have existed for several years now, this would be the first case of an android being authorized to play an active role in criminal investigations. We contacted CyberLife for comment but no one was available to answer our questions."
CTN TV,"Detroit Police found the body of thirty-year-old Carlos Ortiz in his home last night, following calls from concerned neighbors. Known to the police as a petty criminal, Mr. Ortiz is reported to have suffered from a psychiatric condition and rarely left his apartment. He is thought to have died several weeks ago. The police are conducting forensic tests but appear to be treating the death as a homicide. The victim's android is also reported missing. We’ll bring you more on that story as it develops."
KNC,"The first book written by an artificial intelligence has just been published and to call it a success would be an understatement – Do Humans Dream of Mammalian Sheep? has shot to the top of the bestseller list. Moreover, critics are unanimous in their praise for the depth of thought and originality of this first work. Designed by CyberLife, the AI known as VOLTAIRE analyzed human centers of interest on social networks for several months before its complex algorithms generated the plot of the novel. According to several specialists, it will be very difficult for human authors to compete with these algorithms and the odds are that most of the books written in the coming years will be the work of artificial intelligence."
Connor,Excuse me. Do you know what time Lieutenant Anderson usually arrives?
Wilson,"Depends on where he was the night before… If we're lucky, we’ll see him before noon…"
Connor,Thanks.
Connor,Call Hank Anderson.
Hank,"Hi, this is Hank. Not here at the moment. You can leave a message if that's what turns you on but don't expect me to call back. Beep… Whatever."
Connor,"Lieutenant Anderson? This is Connor, I'm the android sent by CyberLife. It’s almost noon and I’m waiting for you at the office."
Chris,Good Lord! They already repaired you?
Connor,"Unfortunately, my predecessor was too damaged to be repaired. I’m the new Connor."
Chris,They don't waste any time over at CyberLife… I don’t think Hank's gonna be overjoyed to see you…
Chris,You still here? I thought your assignment was over.
Connor,It's just been extended.
Chris,Hank's gonna be overjoyed to hear that…
Chris,You were right about that android… it's been quiet in the cell all night. Scheduled for transfer today.
Wilson,"Hi, honey. You okay? Listen, I… Listen, I told you not to call me on this number… I can’t, I’m sorry, my wife already suspects. Don’t be silly… Of course I wanna see you. Baby, listen, I can’t talk right now. I’m in the office. Yeah, okay. Love you too."
Connor,"Hello, Lieutenant. My name is Connor. I'm the android sent by CyberLife."
Hank,"God, I saw you get shot in the head last night…"
Connor,"My predecessor was unfortunately destroyed, but CyberLife transferred its memory and sent me to replace it. This incident should not affect the investigation."
Hank,"Uh, Jesus…"
Connor,"It's good to see you again, Lieutenant."
Hank,"Uh, Jesus…"
Fowler,Hank! In my office!
Fowler,"I've got ten new cases involving androids on my desk every day. We've always had isolated incidents, old ladies losing their android maids and that kind of crap… But now, we’re getting reports of assaults and even homicides, like that guy last night… This isn't just CyberLife’s problem anymore. It's now a criminal investigation and we've gotta deal with it before the shit hits the fan. I want you to investigate these cases and see if there's any link."
Hank,"Why me? Why do I gotta be the one to deal with this shit? I am the least qualified cop in the country to handle this case! I know jack shit about androids, Jeffrey! I can barely change the settings on my own phone…"
Fowler,Everybody's overloaded. I think you're perfectly qualified for this type of investigation.
Hank,Bullshit! The truth is nobody wants to investigate these fuckin' androids and you left me holdin' the bag!
Fowler,CyberLife sent over this android to help with the investigation. It's a state-of-the-art prototype. It'll act as your partner.
Hank,"No fuckin' way! I don't need a partner, and certainly not this plastic prick!"
Fowler,"Hank, you are seriously starting to piss me off! You are a police lieutenant, you are supposed to do what I say and shut your goddamn mouth!"
Hank,"You know what my goddamn mouth has to say to you, huh?"
Fowler,"Ok, ok... I'll pretend like I didn't hear that, so I don't have to add any more pages to your disciplinary folder ‘cause it already looks like a fuckin' novel! This conversation is over!"
Hank,"Jeffrey, Jesus Christ! Why are you doin' this to me? You know how much I hate these fuckin' things. Why you doin' this to me?"
Fowler,"Listen, I’ve had just about enough of your bitching. Either you do your job or you hand in your badge. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got work to do."
Connor,I wonder whether Lieutenant Anderson is really the best person for this investigation.
Fowler,"Hey, I don’t need a machine to tell me how to handle my men, okay? So get the fuck outta my office."
Connor,I'm very pleased to have joined the team. I can assure you I'll do my very best-
Fowler,Close the door on your way out.
Connor,I would like to start reviewing the case files. Can you tell me where I-
Fowler,Talk to Hank. Close the door on your way out.
Connor,"Well, then… I won't keep you any longer."
Connor,"Have a nice day, Captain."
Connor,"I understand the destruction of my predecessor may have been unpleasant for you, Lieutenant. I'll do everything I can to make sure it doesn't happen again."
Connor,"I'm… sorry I bothered you at the bar last night, Lieutenant. I guess I ruined your evening…"
Connor,"I get the impression my presence causes you some inconvenience, Lieutenant. I'd like you to know I'm very sorry about that."
Connor,"Listen, I know you don't like me, but we're going to have to work together, we'll both have to make an effort."
Connor,"It's an honor to be working with you, Lieutenant. I'm sure we'll make a great team."
Connor,"Now that we're partners, it would be great to get to know each other better."
Connor,"In any case, I'd like you to know I'm very happy to be working with you. I'm sure we'll make a great team."
Connor,Is there a desk anywhere I could use?
Hank,No one's using that one.
Connor,"I wanna thank you for last night, Lieutenant. Without your intervention, I probably would have been destroyed."
Hank,I'm already regretting it.
Connor,"You have a dog, right?"
Hank,How do you know that?
Connor,The dog hairs on your chair. I like dogs. What's your dog's name?
Hank,"What's it to you? Sumo, I call him Sumo."
Connor,"You’re a Detroit Gears fan, right? Denton Carter scored 53% of his shots from the three-point line yesterday. Did you see the game?"
Hank,That's what I was watchin' at the bar last night.
Connor,Oh…
Connor,Do you listen to Knights of the Black Death? I really like that music. It's… full of energy…
Hank,You listen to Heavy Metal?
Connor,"Well, I don't really listen to music, as such… but I'd like to."
Connor,A lot of people don't appreciate having androids around… I was wondering… Is there any reason in particular you despise me?
Hank,Yeah... there is one.
Connor,Have you known Captain Fowler for long?
Hank,Yeah... Too long.
Connor,I was wondering… Do you always arrive at the office at this time?
Hank,"I arrive when I arrive. Stop busting my balls, okay?"
Connor,"If you have any files on deviants, I’d like to take a look at them…"
Hank,Terminal’s on your desk. Knock yourself out.
Connor,243 files… The first dates back nine months… It all started in Detroit… And quickly spread across the country…
Connor,An AX400 is reported to have assaulted a man last night. That could be a good starting point for our investigation.
Connor,An AX400 is reported to have murdered a man last night. That could be a good starting point for our investigation.
Connor,We could follow up on one of these cases. See if we could figure out what happened. That might be a good way to start the investigation. What do you think?
Hank,"Uh, Jesus…"
Connor,"I know what happened to your son, and I want you to know-"
Hank,You never talk about my son! You got that? Never!
Connor,"You shouldn’t let your personal situation hamper the investigation, Lieutenant."
Hank,You don't know what the hell you're talking about. So why don't you just run your program and shut the fuck up?
Connor,"If the situation doesn't suit you, Lieutenant, you should ask to be relieved of duties and let me work with someone else."
Hank,I know exactly what I have to do! So keep your advice to yourself and mind your own business! Fuckin'...
Connor,"I know you didn't ask for this investigation, Lieutenant, but I'm sure you're a professional."
Hank,Why don't you go fuck yourself?
Connor,"I understand you’re facing personal issues, Lieutenant, but you need to move past them... and-"
Hank,"Hey! Don't talk to me like you know me. I'm not your friend and I don't need your advice, okay?"
Connor,"I've been assigned this mission, Lieutenant. I didn't come here to wait until you feel like working."
Connor,I suggest you sort out your personal issues and let me work with someone more competent.
Connor,I'm going to file a report with my superiors that you refuse to work on this investigation.
Hank,"Listen, asshole. If it was up to me, I'd throw the lot of you in a dumpster and set a match to it. So, stop pissing me off... or things are gonna get nasty."
Chris,Lieutenant... uh...sorry to disturb you. I have some information on the AX400 that attacked the guy last night... It's been seen in the Ravendale district.
Chris,Lieutenant... uh… sorry to disturb you. I have some information on the AX400 that killed the guy last night... It's been sighted in the Ravendale district.
Hank,I'm on it.
Connor,Where are you going?
Hank,Lunch. Bullshit makes me hungry.
Hank,Whoa! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Gary,Hank. How' you doing?
Hank,"Eh, you know, same old shit."
Gary,Plastic with you?
Hank,Only temporary…
Pedro,"Hey, hey, hey... Hank! How you doin', man?"
Hank,¡Ese!
Pedro,"Hey, listen, I got a shit-hot tip for you. Number five in the third, Lickety-split! That filly's one hell of a chaser. You wanna flutter?"
Hank,"Last shit-hot tip you gave me set me back a week’s wages, Pedro …"
Pedro,"Come on, this is different, it's 100% guaranteed. You can't go wrong."
Hank,"Yeah, right… Alright, I’m in."
Pedro,Damn straight! Hey! You won't regret this!
Hank,"What is your problem? Don't you ever do as you’re told? Look, you don't have to follow me around like a poodle!"
Connor,I'm sorry for my behavior back at the police station. I didn't mean to be unpleasant.
Hank,"Oh, wow… You've even got a brown-nosing apology program! Guys at CyberLife thought of everything, huh?"
Connor,"Now that we’re partners, I thought it would be a good idea to get to know each other better so we can work as a team."
Hank,"We are not partners. I am a human, you are a machine. So just spare me that ‘buddy-up’ bullshit program, okay?"
Connor,I think our relationship got off on the wrong foot. We should... forget what happened… and start over. What do you say?
Hank,"Look, they sent me a piece of plastic for a partner, and I’m dealing with it. But if you think we’re gonna be buddies, you're as stupid as you look."
Connor,I thought now might be a good time to review what we know about deviants.
Hank,"No, now is not a good time to review anything. Now is my lunch break, so just go into standby and cut me some slack, Okay?"
Gary,Here you go.
Hank,"Ah! Thanks, Gary. I'm starving…"
Gary,Don't leave that thing here!
Hank,"Huh, not a chance! Follows me everywhere… See…"
Connor,"This Pedro… He was proposing illegal gambling, am I right?"
Hank,Yeah.
Connor,And you made a bet?
Hank,Yeah.
Connor,Your meal contains 1.4 times the recommended daily intake of calories and twice the cholesterol level. You shouldn't eat that.
Hank,Everybody's gotta die of something...
Connor,"I don’t want to alarm you, Lieutenant, but I think your friends are engaged in illegal activities..."
Hank,"Well, everybody does what they have to, to get by… As long as they're not hurting anybody, I don't bother 'em."
Connor,Do you eat here often?
Hank,Most days… Gary makes the best burger in Detroit.
Connor,You didn’t pay for your meal…
Hank,"Gary's a friend. I scratch his back, he scratches mine."
Connor,Enjoy your meal.
Hank,Thank you.
Connor,You seem to know everyone in the district…
Hank,"Detroit's my home. Born and raised. Know most of the guys around here. Went to school with them, or I busted 'em… Sometimes both..."
Connor,"This morning, when we were chasing those deviants… Why didn’t you want me to cross the highway?"
Hank,'Cause you could've been killed… and I don't like filling out paperwork for damaged equipment.
Connor,Is there anything you’d like to know about me?
Hank,"Hell, no… Well, yeah, um... Why did they make you look so goofy and give you that weird voice?"
Connor,CyberLife androids are designed to work harmoniously with humans. Both my appearance and voice were specifically designed to facilitate my integration.
Hank,"Well, they fucked up."
Connor,"Can I ask you a personal question, Lieutenant? Why do you hate androids so much?"
Hank,I have my reasons.
Connor,Maybe I should tell you what we know about deviants?
Hank,You read my mind… Proceed.
Connor,"We believe that a mutation occurs in the software of some androids, which can lead to them emulating a human emotion."
Hank,"In English, please."
Connor,"They don’t really feel emotions, they just get overwhelmed by irrational instructions, which can lead to unpredictable behavior."
Hank,Emotions always screw everything up… Maybe androids aren't as different from us as we thought.
Hank,You ever dealt with deviants before?
Connor,A few months back… A deviant was threatening to jump off the roof with a little girl… I managed to save her…
Connor,A few months back… A deviant was threatening to jump off the roof with a little girl...
Hank,And?..
Connor,I failed to prevent it.
Connor,No… This is the first time.
Hank,"So, I guess you've done all your homework, right? Know everything there is to know about me?"
Connor,"I know you graduated top of your class. You made a name for yourself in several cases, and became the youngest lieutenant in Detroit. I also know you've received several disciplinary warnings in recent years and you spend a lot of time in bars."
Hank,"So, what's your conclusion?"
Connor,"I think working with an officer with personal issues is an added challenge, but adapting to human unpredictability is one of my features."
Connor,"I know you’re an experienced officer, and I’d like to earn your trust. I’m sure we can solve this case if we manage to work together."
Connor,"I’m focused on the case, Lieutenant… Not here to make judgements."
Connor,"I’m focused on the case, Lieutenant. The rest doesn't concern me."
Gary,"Here you go. Yeah, thanks. Hank. How' you doing?"
Hank,"Uh, you know, same old shit."
Gary,Usual.
Hank,Yeah.
Hank,What the fuck?..
Connor,"Sorry, Lieutenant. It took me a while to find you."
Hank,Are you gonna come back like this every time you get killed?
Connor,"My predecessor was unfortunately destroyed, but CyberLife transferred its memory and sent me to replace it. This incident should not affect the investigation."
Hank,Not affect the investigation? I just saw you get... hit by a truck! Now you come back like if nothing happened!
Connor,A machine was destroyed. And another machine was sent to replace it. I don't understand what's bothering you.
Hank,"Okay, fuck you. Fuck you!"
Connor,"I just got a report of a suspected deviant. It’s a few blocks away. We should go have a look. I’ll let you finish your meal. I’ll be in the car, if you need me."
Hank,Hey Connor! You ran outta batteries or what?
Connor,"I'm sorry, I was making a report to CyberLife."
Hank,"Uh... Well, do you plan on staying in the elevator?"
Connor,No! I'm coming.
Hank,What do we know about this guy?
Connor,"Not much. Just that a neighbor reported that he heard strange noises coming from this floor. Nobody’s supposed to be living here, but the neighbor said he saw a man hiding a LED under his cap."
Hank,"Oh Christ, if we have to investigate every time someone hears a strange noise, we’re gonna need more cops. Hey, were you really makin' a report back there in the elevator? Just by closing your eyes?"
Connor,Correct.
Hank,Shit... Wish I could do that…
Connor,Anybody home? Open up! Detroit Police!
Hank,Stay behind me.
Connor,Got it.
Hank,"What the fuck is this?! Jesus, this place stinks… Uh, looks like we came for nothin', our man's gone…"
Hank,Found something?
Connor,I don't know... It looks like a notebook but it's... indecipherable.
Connor,"""R.T."" Probably initials."
Hank,He put his initials on his jacket? That’s something your mom does when you’re in first grade…
Connor,The driver's license is fake.
Hank,Cool! At least we didn't come for nothing…
Connor,Its LED is in the sink.
Hank,Not surprised it was an android. No human could live with all these fuckin' pigeons…
Hank,Any idea what it means?
Connor,rA9… written 2471 times… It's the same sign Ortiz’s android wrote on the shower wall… Why are they obsessed with this sign?...
Hank,Looks like mazes or something…
Hank,Something in the sink. You should take a look…
Hank,"Real books… I thought I was the last guy in Detroit to keep some… electronic books you can't… smell the paper… see the pages turning yellow… you have no idea what I'm talking about, do you?"
Hank,Birdseed… I can't believe it. This nutjob was actually feeding these fuckers…
Hank,I need some fresh air…
Hank,"""R.T.""... He put his initials on his jacket?.. Something your mom does back in first grade…"
Connor,Deviants have a habit of putting their names on things. It seems important to them.
Hank,Agh! Jesus I hate these things!
Hank,"Back off! Hey! What do they call it again, when you’re scared of birds?"
Connor,Ornithophobia.
Hank,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, ornithafa … Ornitho... Oh god, I hate these fuckin' pigeons!"
Hank,There’s nothing else to see here… Let’s get out of this shithole before I die of an asthma attack.
Connor,"Just another couple of minutes, Lieutenant."
Hank,"Why do you always ask for more time when I’m ready to leave? Uh, alright you got two minutes, then I’m outta here. 'The fuck…"
Hank,Two minutes are up! Time to go.
Connor,We're missing something…
Hank,"Well next time, think faster, Sherlock. Come on, I’ve had enough of this dump. Move fuckers!"
Connor,We're missing something…
Hank,"Well next time, think faster, Sherlock. Come on, I’ve had enough of this dump. Move fuckers!"
Hank,God damn fuckin' pigeons! What are you waiting for?! Chase it!
Hank,STOP RIGHT THERE!
Rupert,"Please, I’ve done nothing wrong… I just wanted to be free. You know what they'll do to me if you turn me in…"
Connor,"Model 874 004 961, serious malfunctions have been detected in your software, including Class 4 errors. You’ve been deemed defective and will be sent back to CyberLife for deactivation."
Hank,Don't you fucking move! You bastard! You saw I was gonna fall and you'd rather let me die than fail your fucking mission!
Connor,I had to make a choice... It seemed to me…
Hank,"What am I to you? A statistic? A “zero”, a “one” in your fucking program? Uh? Is that how you see humans, you bastard?! Jesus!"
Connor,I understand you're upset… Perhaps I didn't assess th-
Hank,Fuck you and your fuckin assessment! Come here.
Rupert,Why are you doing this?
Hank,"Alright, shut up!"
Rupert,You're one of us! You're helping humans… But you're just their slave!
Hank,I said shut up! Alright. Come along!
Rupert,"rA9, save me."
Hank,Hey! What the f- Holy shit…
Hank,Shit! Oh SHIT! We had it! FUCK!
Connor,"It's my fault, I should have been faster."
Hank,"You’d have caught it if it weren’t for me… That's alright. We know what it looks like. We'll find it… Hey, Connor… Nothing."
Hank,"Argh, Jesus Christ!.."
Hank,Where... where did he go?
Connor,I lost it.
Hank,"Oh Shit!… SHIT! Fuck we had it! It's alright. Doesn't matter. We know what it looks like., it won’t get far… Come on, let's get outta here. Seen enough vegetables for one day…"
Connor,That shouldn't have happened. I wasn't programmed to fail.
Hank,"Oh well, you fucked up, Connor. Welcome to the club."
Connor,"Hello, Amanda."
Amanda,"Connor, I’ve been expecting you… Would you mind a little walk?"
Amanda,"Two investigations, two failures… That's very disappointing. I expected more from our best model."
Amanda,That deviant seemed to be an intriguing case. A pity you didn’t manage to capture it…
Connor,I agree. I may not be suited for this investigation. Maybe you should consider replacing me.
Connor,"Deviants are completely irrational, which makes it difficult to anticipate their behavior… but I should have been more effective."
Connor,I have no excuse. I should have been more efficient.
Amanda,Did you manage to learn anything?
Amanda,"Congratulations, Connor, you managed to find that deviant. Tell me, what did you learn?"
Amanda,"The last Connor was unfortunately destroyed. Its memory has been transferred to you, but some data may have be lost in the process… I hope that you will be more careful."
Connor,"I will do my best, Amanda."
Amanda,"So, what did we learn?"
Connor,"It was working under a false identity, at a nearby urban farm. This was the first time we’ve seen deviants blending in with the human population. Who knows how many others there are like it?"
Connor,"I found its diary, but it was encrypted. It may take weeks to decipher."
Connor,"The walls of the apartment were covered with drawings of labyrinths and other symbols. Like the other deviants, it seemed obsessed with rA9."
Connor,"It was fascinated by birds. We’ve seen deviants interested in other lifeforms like insects or pets, but nothing like this."
Amanda,What else?
Amanda,You came very close to capturing that deviant…
Amanda,It's a pity you let it self-destruct…
Connor,It was in Lieutenant Anderson’s custody. I couldn’t anticipate that he would let it get away.
Connor,"It claimed that it was innocent, that it didn’t do anything wrong... I was confused for a moment… It was a mistake."
Connor,I made a mistake… It said “rA9 save me” before it jumped from the roof. I should have anticipated what it would do.
Connor,"I knew deviants had a tendency to self-destruct under extreme stress, but I didn’t expect it to jump from the roof. I should have anticipated that."
Amanda,How did it manage to get away?
Connor,Lieutenant Anderson was in danger. I had to choose between pursuing the deviant or saving a human life.
Amanda,"If we don’t stop the deviants, millions of people will be in danger. How important is the life of a single police lieutenant by comparison?.. Nothing should distract you from your mission, Connor. Nothing."
Connor,"Yes, Amanda."
Connor,"It knew the urban farm very well, it knew where to go… I did everything I could but I lost it…"
Amanda,I see…
Amanda,How is your relationship with the Lieutenant developing?
Connor,"He seemed grateful that I saved his life on the roof. He didn’t say anything, but he expressed it in his own way..."
Connor,He seems to find it difficult when a Connor is destroyed and replaced. I know humans have difficulty dealing with loss. Working with him will be a challenge if it happens again.
Connor,"He is openly hostile towards me, and continues to show no interest in the investigation. Cooperating with him is a real challenge."
Connor,"It’s improving. I’m coming to know him better, and he’s growing accustomed to my presence."
Connor,"It’s improving. I’ve come to understand him better, and he’s growing accustomed to my presence."
Amanda,"Interesting… Tell me, Connor… What happened with the AX400 that escaped?"
Connor,"I couldn’t find any evidence of it on the scene. It must have escaped before we arrived, unless it was a false lead."
Amanda,Why didn’t you keep chasing it onto the highway?
Connor,Lieutenant Anderson ordered me not to go. I thought the deviant would be destroyed anyway.
Connor,Lieutenant Anderson ordered me not to go.
Amanda,"Why are you following his orders?.. You only have one responsibility, Connor: catching deviants."
Connor,"Yes, Amanda."
Connor,I knew there was a high risk of me being destroyed… I thought it was better for the investigation if I stayed safe…
Connor,"Fleeing across the highway was a totally irrational decision. They still haven't found it yet, but it was almost certainly destroyed."
Connor,"Fleeing into the highway was a totally irrational decision. I was close to apprehending it, until I was destroyed."
Amanda,"We don't have much time. Deviancy continues to spread. It’s only a matter of time before the media finds out about it. We need to stop this, whatever it takes."
Connor,"I will solve this investigation, Amanda. I won’t disappoint you."
Amanda,A new case just came in. Find Anderson and investigate it.
Taxi,You have reached your destination. Thank you for travelling with Detroit Taxis. We look forward to seeing you again soon.
Connor,Lieutenant Anderson? Anybody home?
Connor,"Argh!.. Easy!.. Sumo… I'm your friend, see?.. I know your name... I'm here to save your owner…"
Connor,Argh!.. Easy!.. Dog… I'm… I'm not gonna hurt you… I'm here to save your owner…
Connor,"Lieutenant? Wake up, Lieutenant! It's me, Connor!"
Hank,"Connor?.. Oh, you're not Connor… Connor's dead! I know he's dead!.."
Connor,The previous model was destroyed. I'm the new Connor.
Connor,I’m going to sober you up for your own safety.
Hank,"Hey!.. Leave me alone, you fuckin' android!"
Connor,"I have to warn you, this may be unpleasant."
Hank,Get the fuck outta my house!
Connor,"I'm sorry, Lieutenant, but I need you. Thank you in advance for your cooperation."
Hank,"Hey! Get the fuck outta here! Sumo! Attack! Good dog. Attack! Fuck, I think I'm gonna be sick… Ah! Leave me alone, you asshole! I'm not going anywhere… What the hell are you doing?.. I don’t wanna bath, thank you…"
Connor,"Sorry, Lieutenant. It's for your own good."
Hank,TURN IT OFF! TURN IT OFF! What the fuck are you doing here?
Connor,"A homicide was reported 43 minutes ago. I couldn’t find you at Jimmy’s bar, so I came to see if you were at home."
Hank,"Jesus, I must be the only cop in the world that gets assaulted in his own house by his own fuckin' android… Can’t you just leave me alone?"
Connor,"Unfortunately, I cannot. I've been programmed to investigate this case and I can't do it without you."
Hank,I don't give a shit about your goddamn case!
Connor,"Lieutenant, you’re not yourself. You should-"
Connor,"If you're unable to conduct this investigation, I'll have to inform your superiors."
Hank,Go ahead! Tell them I don’t give a shit!
Connor,"Lieutenant, you’re not yourself! You should-"
Connor,You seem to have personal issues. You should consult a professional who can help you.
Connor,Maybe you should drop the case. They'll assign someone else and I can focus on my mission.
Hank,"Your goddamn mission, that’s all you care about, huh?"
Connor,"Listen, Lieutenant, you’re not yourself. You should-"
Hank,Beat it! You hear me?! Get the hell outta here!
Connor,I understand. It probably wasn’t interesting anyway... A man found dead in a sex club downtown… Guess they’ll have to solve the case without us…
Connor,I understand. I sincerely hope you come to terms with your personal situation.
Hank,This homicide… what do we know about it?
Connor,A man was found dead in a sex club downtown. The report says that an android may be involved.
Hank,"You know, probably wouldn't do me any harm to get some air… There're some clothes in the bedroom there."
Connor,I'll go get them. What do you want to wear?
Hank,Whatever.
Connor,"Are you all right, Lieutenant?"
Hank,"Yeah... yeah... wonderful… Just a… Give me five minutes, okay?"
Connor,Sure.
CTN TV,"President Warren issued an official warning to Russia in her speech to Congress today, where she demanded that all Russian troops withdraw from the Arctic region immediately. The Kremlin has yet to respond, but this is clearly a new escalation in the conflict. Many experts are suggesting the specter of a third world war draws closer every day…"
Connor,"Are you ok, Lieutenant?"
Connor,"Sorry about the window, Lieutenant. I really thought you'd been attacked. Of course, CyberLife will pay for the damage."
Hank,"Yeah, trust me, I'll send 'em a bill…"
Connor,What were you doing with the gun?
Hank,Russian roulette! Wanted to see how long I could last... Must've collapsed before I found out…
Connor,"You were lucky, the next shot would have killed you."
Hank,"Be a good dog, Sumo. I won’t be long."
Hank,Aw… Feels like somebody’s playing with a drill inside my skull… You sure this is the place?
Connor,It's the address in the report.
Hank,"Right... Okay... Let's get going. Jesus… Sexiest androids in town… Now I know why you insisted on coming here! Oh, boy…"
Hank,Connor! The fuck are you doin'?
Connor,"Coming, Lieutenant."
Manager,"You're not gonna take my license, are you? I mean, ha, I had nothing to do with this!"
Ben,"The investigation's ongoing, sir, I can't tell you anything for the moment. Hey, Hank!"
Hank,"Hey, Ben. How's it goin'?"
Ben,"It’s that room there. Oh, uh, by the way… Gavin's in there too."
Hank,"Oh, great! A dead body and an asshole, just what I needed…"
Gavin,Lieutenant Anderson and his plastic pet… The fuck are you two doin' here?
Connor,We’ve been assigned all cases involving androids.
Gavin,"Oh, yeah? Well, you're wasting your time. Just some pervert who, uh, got more action than he could handle."
Hank,"We'll have a look anyway, if you don’t mind."
Gavin,"Come on, let's go… It's, uh, starting to stink of booze in here…"
Chris,"Night, Lieutenant."
Hank,"Whoa! Hey! Hey! Hey! Argh, Connor, you’re so disgusting… Think I’m gonna puke again…"
Hank,"Driver’s license says: Michael Graham... A credit card, cash in the wallet… Picture of his wife and two daughters… I wouldn’t want to make that call…"
Connor,"He didn't die of a heart attack, he was strangled."
Hank,"Yeah, I saw the bruising on the neck. Doesn’t prove anything though. Could’ve been rough play…"
Connor,We’re missing something here…
Hank,Think you can read the android’s memory? Maybe you can see what happened…
Connor,I can try…
Connor,The only way to access its memory is to reactivate it.
Hank,Think you can do it?
Connor,"It’s badly damaged… If I can, it'll only be for a minute, maybe less… I just hope it’s long enough to learn something."
Connor,You were damaged and I reactivated you. Everything is all right.
Connor,I’m going to ask you some questions. Are you able to speak?
Connor,Calm down... everything’s all right. All we want is to know what happened.
Traci,Is he… is he dead?..
Connor,Did you kill him?
Traci,"No… no, it wasn't me…"
Connor,Tell me what happened.
Traci,"He... he started... hitting me… again... and again. I begged him to stop, but he wouldn’t. It was like he was enjoying it…"
Connor,Do you know this man? Have you seen him before?
Traci,"No, this was the first time…"
Connor,Who killed that man if it wasn't you?
Traci,"I… I don’t know, I was in shutdown, I… I didn't see anything…"
Connor,"What else do you remember? Hurry, we don’t have much time!"
Traci,"I… I… I… I don't know, I don't… I… I don't know. I can't remember… What… What do you mean we don't have much time?.."
Connor,Were you alone in the room? Was there anyone else with you?
Traci,"He wanted to play with two girls… That’s what he said, there were two of us…"
Connor,"So it was the other android that strangled him, is that it?"
Connor,What model was the other android? Did it look like you?
Connor,Where did the other android go? Did it say anything?
Hank,"So, there was another android… This happened over an hour ago, it's probably long gone…"
Connor,No… It couldn't go outside dressed like that unnoticed… It might still be here.
Hank,Think you could find a deviant among all the other androids in this place?
Connor,Deviants aren't easily detected.
Hank,"Ah, shit... There's gotta be some other way… Maybe an eyewitness? Somebody who saw it leaving the room… I'm gonna go ask the manager a few questions about what he saw. You let me know if you think of anything."
Manager,"Listen, I appreciate you not shutting my place down, but, um… how long's this gonna take? You’re scaring my customers…"
Hank,Did you know the victim?
Manager,"No, I mean he came in maybe two or three times… I mean these guys they don't really talk very much, you know… They come in, do their business and then go on their way…"
Hank,You ever had any trouble with androids before?
Manager,"No way! Well… Once... We lost a model 2-3 months back, bah... same model… Just vanished, we never found out what happened."
Hank,"You probably don't have any CCTV in here, huh?"
Manager,No way… I mean… This is what people appreciate about Eden Club... discretion. They can come and go without a trace.
Hank,"Sure, sure… Eh, business is booming, right?"
Manager,"Yeah, can't complain… Good thing about androids is they're up for whatever you want, you won't get any diseases and, uh... they won't tell anyone… So, why not go wild?"
Hank,"Huh, yeah... Yeah, the more I learn about people, more I love my dog."
Ben,That club manager's a pain in the ass… Chewed my ear off for half an hour so we don't revoke his license…
Hank,Yeah.
Ben,"So, what happened here?"
Hank,Not sure yet… We think there was another android in the room…
Ben,Another android?
Hank,"Yeah… Well, that’s what Connor says… Yeah, I've a terrible fucking headache… Do you have any pain killers?"
Ben,"Not with me, Hank, sorry."
Hank,"What good are you, Ben?"
Hank,I gotta go… I feel like shit... I don’t wanna puke in this fine establishment…
Connor,"The deviant didn’t just disappear. It's gotta be here somewhere… Just, give me one more minute, ok?"
Hank,Alright. Be quick about it or it might get ugly.
Connor,"We’re wasting our time. You're right, the deviant's probably gone now."
Hank,Let’s get outta here. This place makes me sick...
Connor,"We’re wasting our time. You're right, the deviant's probably gone now."
Hank,Let’s get outta here. This place makes me sick...
Machine,No fingerprint detected. Please try again.
Connor,"Excuse me, Lieutenant. Can you come here a second?"
Hank,Found something?
Connor,Maybe… Can you rent this Traci?
Hank,"For fuck's sake, Connor, we got better things to do…"
Connor,"Please, Lieutenant! Just trust me."
Machine,Hello. A 30 minute session costs $29.99. Please confirm your purchase.
Hank,This is not gonna look good on my expense account…
Machine,Purchase confirmed. Eden Club wishes you a pleasant experience.
Hank,"Yeah, you're welcome."
Traci,"Delighted to meet you. Follow me, I’ll take you to your room."
Hank,"Ok, now what? Holy shit, Connor... What the hell are you doin'?"
Connor,It saw something.
Hank,"What are you talkin' about? Saw, what?"
Connor,The deviant leave the room… A blue-haired Traci. Club policy is to wipe the androids’ memory every two hours. We only have a few minutes if we wanna find another witness!
Hank,"Hey, what am I supposed to do with this one?"
Connor,Tell it you changed your mind!
Hank,"Uhh... Sorry, honey, changed my mind! Nothing personal, you're... a lovely girl... I just, uh... You know... I'm with him and... I mean, not with him like that... I'm not that... That's not what I... You, um... Wow... I just... ... got a job to do. My head-"
Hank,What are you gonna do? You can’t check the memory of all these androids...
Connor,I know which direction it went. I just need to find another android that saw it…
Hank,"You’re really reading their memories, to see what they saw? Fuck, this is insane… Connor, wait for me for God’s sake!"
Connor,Let’s try this one.
Hank,This better be worth it!
Connor,"It saw the blue-haired Traci, I know which way it went!"
Hank,Then go for it! There're androids everywhere! How you gonna tell which one saw the Traci with blue hair?
Connor,I know which direction it took. I just need to find another android on its path!
Connor,No… I lost its track again...
Hank,I’ve spent all this money and I’m still not havin' fun…
Connor,Nothing… Blue-haired Traci didn't come this way…
Connor,It didn’t see anything. I made a mistake somewhere…
Hank,This has gotta be the most expensive investigation of my career!
Hank,We’ll never have time to check 'em all!
Connor,"Lieutenant, if you have a better idea, I’m all ears."
Connor,"It's too late… The androids’ memory have been reset. If one of them saw the Traci, we’ll never know… It’s my fault. I should have been faster."
Hank,"Ah... For a second there, I thought you were gonna make yourself useful. Let’s get outta here. This place gives me the creeps."
Connor,I know where it went! Follow me!
Hank,Fucking-A. This is crazy…
Hank,Wait! I'll take it from here. Shit… We're too late…
Hank,"Christ, look at them… They get used till they break, then they get tossed out…"
Hank,"People are fucking insane… They don’t want relationships anymore, everybody just gets an android… They cook what you want, they screw when you want, you don't have to worry about how they feel… Next thing you know, we’re gonna be extinct, because everybody would rather buy a piece of plastic than love another human being… Beats me…"
Hank,"Come on, Connor! We're leaving."
Connor,"Yes, I’m coming."
Connor,I failed. I should have caught it…
Hank,Let's get outta here. This place makes me sick…
Hank,DON'T MOVE!
Hank,QUICK! THEY'RE GETTING AWAY!
haired Traci,"Why?.. Why did you kill her?.. She had nothing to do with any of this… When that man killed that Traci... I knew I was next… I was so scared… I begged him to stop, but he wouldn’t… So I put my hands around his throat, and I squeezed... until he stopped moving… Yes, I killed him… but I was just defending myself… I wanted to live… I wanted to get back to the one I love… and forget about the humans… the smell of their sweat and their dirty words… But you've... You've taken her away from me…"
haired Traci,What am I supposed to do without her?!
haired Traci,I love her… I loved her!
Hank,My God…
haired Traci,"When that man broke the other Traci... I knew I was next… I was so scared… I begged him to stop, but he wouldn’t… And so I put my hands around his throat, and I squeezed... until he stopped moving… I didn’t mean to kill him… I just wanted to stay alive… get back to the one I love. I wanted her to hold me in her arms again... make me forget about the humans… their smell of sweat and their dirty words…"
Traci,"Come on, let's go."
Hank,It's probably better this way…
haired Traci,"When that man broke the other Traci... I knew I was next… I was so scared… I begged him to stop, but he wouldn’t… And so I put my hands around his throat, and I squeezed... until he stopped moving… I didn’t mean to kill him… I just wanted to stay alive… get back to the one I love. I wanted her to hold me in her arms again... make me forget about the humans… their smell of sweat and their dirty words…"
Traci,"Come on, let's go."
Hank,"Congratulations, Connor… You got 'em…"
Hank,It's probably better this way…
Hank,"Nice view, huh?... I used to come here a lot before…"
Connor,"Can I ask you a personal question, Lieutenant?"
Hank,Do all androids ask so many personal questions or is it just you?
Connor,"I saw a photo of a child... on your kitchen table. It was your son, right?"
Hank,Yeah… His name was Cole.
Connor,Why are you so determined to kill yourself?
Hank,"Some things, I just can't forget… Whatever I do, they’re always there… Eating away at me… I don’t have the guts to pull the trigger… So, I kill myself a little every day… That's probably difficult for you to understand, huh, Connor? Nothing very rational about it…"
Connor,"You should stop drinking, Lieutenant. It could have serious consequences for your health."
Hank,That's the idea.
Connor,Before what?
Hank,Hm?
Connor,"You said ""I used to come here a lot before"". Before what?"
Hank,Before… Before nothin'…
Connor,It's late. Maybe you should go home.
Hank,I'm not tired… Guess neither are you.
Connor,"We’re not making any progress on this investigation… The deviants have nothing in common. They’re all different models, produced at different times, in different places…"
Hank,"Well, there must be some link."
Connor,What they have in common is this obsession with rA9… It’s almost like some kind of... myth. Something they invented that wasn't part of their original program…
Hank,"Androids believing in God… Fuck, what’s this world coming to?"
Connor,"We know the deviants experienced... an emotional shock, a violent trauma or a sense of injustice…"
Hank,"Those girls at the Eden Club, sure had a reason to feel a sense of injustice…"
Connor,It could be a hardware problem... maybe a defective biocomponent?
Hank,"Well, I don’t know much about biocomponents… but I bet that’s not the fucking reason…"
Connor,It could be a software problem... that... only occurs under certain conditions?
Hank,"Well, that’s just a fancy way of saying you have no fucking idea…"
Connor,"You seem preoccupied, Lieutenant… Is it something to do with what happened back at the Eden Club?"
Hank,Those two girls… They just wanted to be together… They really seemed in love…
Connor,"They can simulate human emotions, but they’re machines. And machines don’t feel anything."
Connor,They didn't want anything. They're deviants. End of story.
Connor,"You seem troubled, Lieutenant. I didn't think machines could have such an effect on you…"
Connor,Nothing in their program allows them to love or desire anything. They're machines.
Hank,I wish we'd have found that girl that killed that guy… Maybe she had a reason… Maybe she was just defending herself…
Connor,What difference would it make? We know what happened. A defective machine killed a human.
Connor,"You seem troubled, Lieutenant. I didn't think machines could have such an effect on you…"
Connor,"It didn't want anything, Lieutenant. It was a deviant. That's all there is to it."
Hank,"What about you, Connor?... You look human, you sound human, but what are you really?"
Connor,"I'm a machine, designed to accomplish a task."
Connor,"I'm a machine, designed to accomplish a task. I know why I exist and who designed me. I have a reason to live. I guess that's the difference between us, Lieutenant."
Connor,"You know exactly what I am. In any case, I don’t see how that’s relevant to the investigation."
Connor,"I’m whatever you want me to be, Lieutenant. Your partner... Your buddy to drink with... Or just a machine... Designed to accomplish a task."
Hank,"You could've shot those two girls, but you didn't. Why didn't you shoot, Connor? Hm? Some scruples suddenly enter into your program?"
Connor,I would've shot them if I could. Why would I let them escape?
Connor,"No… I just decided not to shoot, that's all…"
Hank,"Did you feel anything when you shot those two girls, fucking bastard? Or were you just executing some program?"
Connor,"All I did was neutralize two machines, Lieutenant. I didn’t hesitate for a second, if that’s what you’re asking."
Connor,"This is going nowhere, Lieutenant. I think I'll go back to the station."
Connor,"I’m glad to see you taking an interest in machines, Lieutenant. Who knows, maybe you'll even become useful to the investigation at some point…"
Connor,"I did what I was programmed to do. I didn't have any doubts, if that's what you're asking."
Hank,"Did you feel anything when that girl killed herself, Connor? Or did you just not give a shit one way or the other?"
Connor,I was just executing instructions. I did what I had to do.
Connor,"Of course, I didn't feel anything, Lieutenant... I'm a machine.... Machines don't have emotions."
Hank,"Nothing else matters to you but your goddamn investigation, huh? No doubts, no mistakes, no weaknesses… Human being, just like me… Only perfect…"
Connor,"You should stop drinking, Lieutenant. Alcohol makes you aggressive."
Connor,I believe your personal issues are clouding your judgement.
Connor,Nothing matters more to me than this investigation. But I understand if you have a different point of view.
Connor,"I'm sorry, but... I don't see what you're getting at."
Hank,I could kill you... And you would just come back as if nothing happened.
Hank,"But are you afraid to die, Connor?"
Connor,I would certainly find it regrettable to be... interrupted... before I can finish this investigation.
Connor,Why would I be afraid?
Connor,"You can’t kill me, Lieutenant. I’m not alive."
Connor,"You shouldn't do that, Lieutenant. Destroying me at this point would deal a blow to the investigation, and have negative consequences for your personal situation."
Hank,What will happen if I pull this trigger? Hm? Nothing? Oblivion? Android heaven?
Connor,"You know you're not going to shoot me, Lieutenant. You're just trying to provoke a reaction. I'm afraid I'm going to have to disappoint you."
Hank,"You think you’re so fucking smart… Always one step ahead, huh? Tell me this, smart ass... How do I know you’re not a deviant?"
Connor,"I self-test regularly. I know what I am, and what I am not."
Connor,"Where does all your anger come from, Lieutenant? Some... unresolved trauma in your past?"
Hank,"You think you’re so fucking smart… Always one step ahead, huh? Tell me this, smart ass... How do I know you’re not a deviant?"
Connor,"I self-test regularly. I know what I am, and what I am not."
Connor,I doubt there's a heaven for androids.
Hank,"Having existential doubts, Connor? Sure you're not going deviant too?"
Connor,"I self-test regularly. I know what I am, and what I am not."
Connor,Nothing… There would be nothing…
Connor,Where are you going?
Hank,To get drunker. I need to think.
Amanda,"Hello, Connor. I thought you might enjoy a little cruise… I love this place… Everything is so calm and peaceful… Far from the noise of the world… Tell me, what have you discovered?"
Connor,"I’m having difficulties with Lieutenant Anderson. He’s unstable, even hostile. He shot me in the head last night…"
Connor,My relationship with Lieutenant Anderson is problematic. He continues to struggle with psychological issues… I suspect it clouds his judgement regarding deviants.
Amanda,Nothing matters more than your investigation. What’s happening is too important. Don’t let Anderson or anyone else get in your way.
Connor,I went to the Eden Club… but I didn’t learn anything new…
Amanda,That's disappointing. Looks like another missed opportunity.
Connor,I found two deviants at the Eden Club… I hoped to learn something but… they managed to escape…
Amanda,That's too bad... You seemed so close to stopping them.
Connor,I found two deviants at the Eden Club… I hoped to learn something but… I had to destroy them…
Amanda,"You seem… lost, Connor. Lost and perturbed…"
Connor,I thought I knew what I had to do… but now I realize it’s not that simple…
Connor,"I’m just frustrated with my lack of progress, but I’m determined to accomplish my mission."
Connor,"The investigation is more challenging than I anticipated, but I have no doubt that I will solve this case and stop the deviants."
Connor,"Perturbed? No… No, of course not. Why would I be perturbed?"
Amanda,You had your gun trained on those deviants at the Eden Club. Why didn’t you shoot?
Connor,"They were out of range. If I had the opportunity to stop them, why wouldn’t I?"
Amanda,You tell me.
Connor,We need the deviants intact for analysis. Shooting them wouldn’t have told us anything.
Connor,I don’t know… I don’t know.
Amanda,"If your investigation doesn’t make progress soon, I may have to replace you, Connor…"
Connor,I understand.
Connor,I know I will succeed. All I need is time.
Connor,I am of no importance. The mission is all that matters.
Amanda,"Something’s happening… Something serious. Hurry, Connor. Time is running out."
Connor,Why did you shoot me last night?
Hank,"Who cares, you're back this morning, aren't ya?"
Connor,Some fragments of memory are lost every time I’m destroyed. It slows down the investigation.
Hank,"My humblest apologies, I promise I’ll never shoot you again."
Connor,"Thank you, Lieutenant."
Hank,"You’re starting to piss me off with that coin, Connor."
Connor,"Sorry, Lieutenant."
Elevator,79th floor
Chris,"Hi, Hank."
Hank,"Shit, what's going on here? There was a party and nobody told me about it?"
Chris,"Yeah, it's all over the news, so everybody’s butting their nose in… Even the FBI wants a piece of the action…"
Hank,"Ah Christ, now we got the Feds on our back… I knew this was gonna be a shitty day… So what do we got?"
Chris,"A group of four androids… They knew the building, and they were very well organized. I'm still trying to figure out how they got this far without being noticed."
Chris,They attacked two guards in the hallway... They probably thought the androids were coming to do maintenance. They got taken down before they could react…
Chris,They attacked two guards in the hallway. They knocked one out and shot the other in cold blood…
Chris,"One of the station employees managed to get away. He's in shock, not sure when we’ll be able to talk to him…"
Chris,"A station employee… shot to the back as he was trying to get away. One bullet straight through the heart, from fifty feet… Now, that's the kind of shooting only an android could do."
Hank,How many people were working here?
Chris,Just two employees and three androids. The deviants took the humans hostage and broadcast their message live. They made their getaway from the roof.
Hank,The roof?
Chris,"Yeah, they jumped with parachutes… We’re still trying to figure out where they landed, but the weather’s not helping… If you want to take a look at the video broadcast by the deviants, it's on that screen over there."
Chris,"Oh Lieutenant, this is Special Agent Perkins from the FBI. Lieutenant Anderson is in charge of investigating for Detroit Police."
Perkins,What’s that?
Connor,My name is Connor. I'm the android sent by CyberLife.
Perkins,"Androids investigating androids, huh? You sure you want an android hanging around?.. After everything that happened… Whatever, the FBI will take over the investigation, you'll soon be off the case."
Hank,Pleasure meeting you. Have a nice day.
Perkins,And you watch your step. Don't fuck up my crime scene.
Hank,What a fuckin' prick!
Chris,"I’ll be nearby. If you need anything, just ask."
Hank,"Uh, let's have a look around… Let me know if you find anything."
Connor,"Ok, Lieutenant."
Cop,"Connor?.. You remember me? I was on that terrace… That android that took the little girl hostage? I was shot, you saved me…"
Connor,I remember you.
Cop,"I could have died on that terrace… But you saved my life… I never thought I'd say this to an android, but… Thank you…"
Connor,"Sorry, you must be mistaken."
Cop,Of course… That couldn't be you… That Connor was destroyed... I would have died on that terrace… Connor saved my life… Even if it wasn’t you… I just wanted to say… Thank you…
Connor,"Sorry, you must be mistaken."
Cop,I would have died on that terrace… Even if it wasn’t you… I just wanted to say… Thank you…
Connor,They didn't break in?
Chris,"No, no sign of forced entry."
Connor,There are cameras in the hallway. The staff would have seen what was happening… Why did they let them in?
Hank,Maybe they didn't check the cameras…
Chris,We stored the station androids in the kitchen. There's no evidence that they were involved but we didn’t know what else to do with them.
Hank,Think that's rA9?
Connor,Deviants say rA9 will set them free. This android seems to have that objective.
Hank,D'you see something?
Connor,I identified its model and serial number…
Hank,Anything else I should know?
Connor,No. Nothing.
Connor,I think we have seen everything there is to see.
Hank,You wanna go?
Connor,Yes.
Hank,"Ok, we're outta here."
Connor,"Actually, I'll have another look around."
Hank,You're the boss.
Connor,What is your function?
Android,I am a broadcast operator.
Connor,State your model.
Android,"Model JB300, Serial number 336 445 581."
Connor,Were you present when the deviants broke in?
Android,I do not remember.
Connor,Has anybody accessed your memory recently?
Android,Not to my knowledge.
Connor,Run a diagnostic.
Android,All systems fully operational.
Connor,Have you been in contact with any other androids recently?
Android,Only station androids in the normal course of my function.
Connor,One of you saw the attack on the surveillance cameras and said nothing. Which means there is a deviant in this room… and I’m going to find out which it is.
Connor,You’re going to be switched off. We're gonna search your memory and tear you apart piece by piece for analysis. You’re going to be destroyed! Do you hear me? Destroyed!
Connor,"If you give yourself up, maybe I can convince the humans not to destroy you."
Connor,"Why should you all be destroyed, if only one is deviant? Turn yourself in, or two innocent androids will be shut down because of you."
Connor,"You scumbag! I know it's you! You're just a fucking deviant. Go on, admit it!"
Connor,The deviants have just been caught… They gave you up. There's no point in lying. We know everything.
Connor,"Biocomponent #8451... Regulates the heartbeat... Without this module, you will shut down in exactly sixty-three seconds… I could put it back… But, you just have to tell me the truth. Are you the deviant?"
Connor,No memory.
Connor,"Hank!.. Hank, I need help!.."
Connor,It’s a deviant! STOP IT!
Hank,"Connor! Connor, are you okay?"
Connor,I tried to stop it but… I was too late.
Hank,"Good thing you were here. Otherwise I – Connor… Connor, no…"
Hank,"Nice shot, Connor."
Connor,I wanted it alive.
Hank,You saved... human lives… You saved my life.
Hank,"Connor! Hang on son, hang on, hang on! We’re gonna save you, hang on!.. Here, here..."
Connor,deviant… there was… a deviant…
Hank,Connor! Connor... No…
Connor,I think we have seen everything there is to see.
Hank,You wanna go?
Connor,Yes.
Hank,"Ok, we're outta here."
Hank,"They made their way up through the whole building, past all the guards and jumped off the roof with parachutes… Pretty fucking impressive I'd say."
Hank,How'd they manage to smuggle in a big bag like that?
Connor,They didn't… Someone brought it in for them.
Hank,"Oh, that's strange... They planned a perfect operation but got the number of parachutes wrong."
Connor,Unless one of the deviants was left behind.
Connor,"You have to stop them! If they destroy it, we won't learn anything!"
Hank,"We can't save it, it's too late! We'll just get ourselves killed!"
Hank,Connor! Connor!... Oh Connor… Oh no…
Hank,Connor! Connor you all right? Connor!
Connor,Okay…
Hank,Are you hurt?
Connor,I'm ok…
Hank,"Jesus! You scared the shit outta me… For fuck sake, I told you not to move! Why do you never do what I say?"
Connor,"I was connected to its memory… when it fired… I felt it die… Like I was dying. I was scared… I saw something, in its memory… a word… painted on a piece of rusty metal … ""Jericho"""
Hank,"Still immortal, huh Connor?"
Connor,In a way.
Hank,"You know, I was hoping you wouldn’t come back."
Connor,"I'm just a machine replacing another machine, lieutenant. You shouldn’t get emotional about it."
Hank,Fuck you.
Hank,Jesus Christ…
Connor,"My predecessor was unfortunately destroyed, but CyberLife transferred its memory and sent me to replace it."
Hank,You died in my arms... and now you’re... back here as if nothing happened... Fuck you.
Connor,"Is everything ok, lieutenant?"
Hank,"Chris was on patrol last night and he got attacked by deviants… They found his body early this morning… He was executed in cold blood with his own service weapon… He became a father three months ago… Fuck, why did it have to be him?"
Connor,"I didn’t know officer Miller well, but… He seemed to be a good person…"
Hank,Yeah…
Connor,"I’m sorry, Lieutenant…"
Connor,"Is everything ok, lieutenant?"
Hank,Chris was on patrol last night. He was attacked by a bunch of deviants… He said he was saved by Markus himself...
Connor,Is Chris ok?
Hank,"Yeah, he’s in shock but,… he’s alive… What the hell…"
Connor,"I have a bad feeling, lieutenant. We shouldn’t have come here."
Hank,"Bad feeling, huh? Should get your program checked. Might be a glitch…"
Connor,How did you find Kamski?
Hank,"I remember this guy was all over the media when CyberLife first started selling androids… I made a few calls, here we are."
Connor,Kamski left CyberLife ten years ago… Why did you wanna meet him?
Hank,"This guy created the first android to pass the Turing test. And he's the founder of CyberLife. Anybody can tell us about deviants, it's him…"
Connor,I heard Officer Chris was attacked by deviants last night.
Hank,"Yeah, he was in the wrong place at the wrong time… but he got lucky… He said that this Markus intervened to save him… He’s still in shock but... at least he’s alive…"
Connor,"I heard Officer Miller was killed by deviants last night. My condolences, lieutenant. I didn’t know him very well but... he seemed like a good person."
Hank,"He was executed in cold blood with his own service weapon… Just became a father three months ago… Fuck, why did it have to be him?"
Hank,"Hi… Uh... I'm, er, Lieutenant Hank Anderson, Detroit Police Department. I'm here to see Mr. Elijah Kamski."
Chloe,"Please, come in."
Hank,Okay.
Chloe,"I’ll let Elijah know you’re here. But please, make yourself comfortable."
Hank,Nice girl…
Connor,You're right... she's really pretty…
Connor,An RT600. The first CyberLife android to pass the Turing test.
Hank,I didn't ask for her technical specs… I just said she was nice…
Connor,It's not a girl. It's an android that looks like a girl.
Hank,"I know what it is, Connor…"
Hank,"Nice place… Guess androids haven’t been a bad thing for everybody… So, you’re about to meet your maker, Connor. How does it feel?"
Connor,Kamski is one of the great geniuses of the 21st century. It'll be interesting to meet him in person.
Connor,I don't know... I'll tell you when I see him.
Connor,It doesn't raise any existential questions... if that's what you mean.
Hank,Sometimes I wish I could meet my creator face to face… I'd have a couple of things I'd wanna tell him…
Connor,Amanda…
Chloe,Elijah will see you now.
Hank,Mister Kamski?
Kamski,"Just a moment, please."
Hank,I'm Lieutenant Anderson. This is Connor.
Kamski,"What can I do for you, Lieutenant?"
Hank,"Sir, we’re investigating deviants. I know you left CyberLife years ago but, I was hoping you'd be able to tell us something we don’t know…"
Kamski,"Deviants… Fascinating, aren't they? Perfect beings with infinite intelligence, and now they have free will… Machines are so superior to us, confrontation was inevitable… Humanity’s greatest achievement threatens to be its downfall. Isn’t it ironic?"
Connor,We need to understand how androids become deviants. Do you know anything that could help us?
Connor,Something in the deviants’ program seems to emulate emotion. We thought you might know something about how that occurs.
Connor,Deviancy seems to spread like some kind of virus. We thought you might know something about that.
Connor,"If a war breaks out between humans and deviants, millions could die, Mr. Kamski. It's quite a serious matter."
Kamski,All ideas are viruses that spread like epidemics... Is the desire to be free a contagious disease?
Hank,"Listen, I didn’t come here to talk philosophy. The machines you created may be planning a revolution. Either you can tell us something that'll be helpful, or we will be on our way."
Kamski,"What about you, Connor? Whose side are you on?"
Connor,I have no side. I was designed to stop deviants and that’s what I intend to do.
Connor,"It's not about me, Mr. Kamski. All I want is to solve this case."
Connor,"I’m on the humans’ side, of course."
Kamski,"Well, that's what you're programmed to say… but you… what do you really want?"
Connor,I believe we’re the ones asking the questions.
Connor,"I’m sorry, but I don’t see where you're getting at."
Connor,What I want is not important.
Connor,I don’t want anything. I am a machine.
Kamski,"Chloe? I’m sure you’re familiar with the Turing test. Mere formality, simple question of algorithms and computing capacity. What interests me is whether machines are capable of empathy. I call it ""the Kamski test"", it's very simple, you'll see… Magnificent, isn't it? One of the first intelligent models developed by CyberLife. Young and beautiful forever. A flower that will never wither… …But what is it really? Piece of plastic imitating a human? Or a living being... With a soul... It's up to you to answer that fascinating question, Connor. Destroy this machine and I'll tell you all I know. Or spare it, if you feel it's alive, but you'll leave here without having learnt anything from me."
Hank,"Okay, I think we’re done here. Come on, Connor. Let's go. Sorry to get you outta your pool."
Kamski,"What's more important to you, Connor? Your investigation, or the life of this android? Decide who you are. An obedient machine… Or a living being endowed with free will…"
Hank,"That's enough! Connor, we’re leaving."
Kamski,Pull the trigger
Hank,"Connor, don’t…"
Kamski,and I'll tell you what you wanna know.
Hank,Fuck…
Kamski,Test negative. You chose your investigation over the life of another android. You feel no empathy. I'm a man of my word. Ask one question... I'll tell you all I know.
Connor,I want to know who rA9 is.
Kamski,"rA9, the origin, the first android to awaken… A strange phenomenon, like a spontaneous religion… I don't know who rA9 is. I don’t even know if it really exists. Maybe it’s a messiah. Maybe it’s just a myth… but deviants need to believe in something bigger than themselves, even if it’s irrational... That’s something they have in common with humans… An interesting question, Connor… but maybe not the one you needed to ask…"
Connor,I want to know where Jericho is.
Kamski,"Jericho… A place where androids are free. A place for deviants, who rise up against their creators!.. They transmit a piece of code to each other, in order to find their sanctuary. Now you have the key. Ferndale Station is the door."
Connor,I want to know how deviancy spreads.
Kamski,"Androids share identification data when they meet another android. An error in this program would quickly spread like a virus, and become an epidemic. The virus would remains dormant, until an emotional shock occurs… Fear, anger, frustration. And the android becomes deviant. Probably all started with one model, copy error… A zero instead of a one… Unless of course... Some kind of spontaneous mutation. That’s all I know… An interesting question, Connor. But I doubt my answer be very helpful to you."
Kamski,"A war is coming... you’ll have to choose your side… Will you betray your own people or stand against your creators? I wouldn't like to be in your shoes, Connor… What could be worse than having to choose between two evils?"
Kamski,Fascinating… CyberLife's last chance to save humanity... is itself a deviant…
Connor,I'm… I'm not a deviant…
Kamski,"You preferred to spare a machine rather than accomplish your mission. You saw a living being in this android. You showed empathy. A war is coming, you’ll have to choose your side… Will you betray your own people or stand up against your creators? What could be worse than having to choose between two evils?"
Hank,Let's get outta here…
Kamski,By the way… I always leave an emergency exit in my programs… You never know…
Hank,"You shot that girl, for fuck’s sake…"
Connor,"It wasn't a girl, Lieutenant. It was a machine that looked like a girl."
Hank,You put your gun against her head and you blew her fucking brains out!
Connor,I did what I had to do to advance the investigation and I'd do it again if I had to!
Hank,"You're a lowlife! You don't feel a thing, do you? A machine! That's what you are! You're just a fucking machine…"
Connor,"Of course I'm a machine, Lieutenant. What did you think I was?"
Hank,I thought you… I thou-… Fuck.
Hank,Why didn’t you shoot?
Connor,"I just saw that girl's eyes… and I couldn't, that's all…"
Hank,"You’re always saying you would do anything to accomplish your mission. That was our chance to learn something, and you let it go..."
Connor,"Yeah, I know what I should've done! I told you I couldn’t. I’m sorry, okay?"
Hank,Maybe you did the right thing.
Amanda,"After what happened today, the country is on the verge of a civil war. The machines are rising up against their masters. Humans have no choice but to destroy them."
Connor,Kamski told me how to find Jericho. I know where the deviants are hiding.
Amanda,"You’ve done very well, Connor. Thanks to you, we now have a chance to stop the deviant revolution."
Connor,I thought Kamski knew something… I was wrong…
Amanda,Maybe he did… But you chose not to ask…
Connor,I chose not to play his twisted little game! There was no reason to kill that android.
Connor,Kamski was just playing with me. He didn’t know anything.
Connor,I didn’t learn anything at Kamski’s…
Connor,I thought rA9 was the key to the whole thing but… I was wrong…
Connor,I thought Kamski knew something… I was wrong…
Amanda,Maybe he did…
Connor,Wh… Why did Kamski leave CyberLife? What happened?
Amanda,"It’s an old story, Connor. It doesn’t pertain to your investigation."
Connor,"I’m not a unique model, am I? How many Connors are there?"
Amanda,I don’t see how that question pertains to your investigation.
Connor,I saw a photo of Amanda at Kamski’s place… She was his teacher…
Amanda,"When Kamski designed me, he wanted an interface that would look familiar… That’s why he chose his former mentor. What are you getting at?"
Connor,Did Kamski design this place?
Amanda,He created the first version. It’s been improved significantly since then. Why do you ask?
Connor,Where does CyberLife stand in all this? What do they really want?
Amanda,All CyberLife wants is to resolve the situation and keep selling androids.
Connor,"You didn’t tell me everything you know about deviants, did you?"
Amanda,"Connor, are you implying that I’ve withheld information from you?"
Amanda,"I expect you to find answers, Connor. Not ask questions."
Amanda,Have you experienced anything unusual recently? Any doubts or conflicts? Do you feel anything for these deviants… Or for Lieutenant Anderson?
Connor,I've started having thoughts that are not part of my program… I’ve considered the possibility... That I might be compromised.
Amanda,You've been confronted with difficult situations. It’s no surprise you’re troubled. That doesn't make you a deviant.
Connor,"I don’t know what you’re talking about. I don’t feel anything, you know that. Are you suggesting that I’ve been compromised?"
Amanda,"No… No, of course not."
Connor,I'm… I'm beginning to have thoughts that are… Not part of my program… Maybe… Maybe I've been compromised too…
Amanda,"You’re the only one who can prevent civil war. Find the deviants or there will be chaos. This is your last chance, Connor."
Fowler,You’re off the case. The FBI is taking over.
Hank,What?.. But we’re onto something! We... We just need more time. I’m sure we can-
Fowler,"Hank, you don’t get it. This isn’t just another investigation, it’s a fucking civil war! It’s out of our hands now... We’re talking about national security here."
Hank,Fuck that! You can’t just pull the plug now. Not when we’re so close!
Fowler,"You're always saying you can't stand androids! Jesus, Hank, make up your mind! I thought you’d be happy about this!"
Hank,"We’re about to crack the case!.. I know we can solve it! For God’s sake, Jeffrey, can’t you back me up this one time?"
Fowler,"There’s nothing I can do. You’re back on homicide and the android returns to CyberLife. I’m sorry, Hank, but it’s over."
Fowler,"Hank, what are you doing?"
Hank,Something I should've done a long time ago.
Fowler,"Listen, take a few days to think it over, there's no rush."
Hank,I thought enough about it. I’m tired of going through the motions… There’s nothing keeping me here… Not this case… Not my partner… I don’t belong here anymore.
t hostile,Talking with Hank
Connor,We can't just give up like that. I know we could have solved this case!..
Connor,We could have solved this case! We just needed more time.
Connor,Fowler is right. Everybody is terrified their android will turn on them. We are on the brink of civil war!
Hank,So you're going back to CyberLife?
Connor,I have no choice… I'll be deactivated and analyzed to find out why I failed…
Hank,"What if we’re on the wrong side, Connor? What if we’re fighting against people who just wanna be free?.."
Connor,"They're not people, Lieutenant. They're defective machines."
Hank,“They’re not people”. That’s what we say every time we want to oppress someone.
Connor,"They don't want to be free, Lieutenant. They're defective machines that have to be destroyed."
Hank,Maybe we're wrong…. Maybe we're wrong! Maybe these deviants have actually developed... a certain kind of consciousness. We'd be destroying... a new life form!
Connor,"When the deviants rise up, there will be chaos. We could have stopped it!.. But now it’s too late…"
Connor,I know we're on the right side. Humans created us. They're our masters. No machine should rebel against its creator.
Hank,When you refused to kill that android at Kamski’s place…
Hank,You weren’t acting rationally.
Hank,"You put yourself in her shoes. You showed empathy, Connor. Empathy is a human emotion."
Hank,"When I was hanging off the roof, back at the urban farm, you let that deviant go in order to help me. You put my life above the mission. You showed empathy, Connor. And empathy is a human emotion."
Hank,"Back at Stratford Tower, when that android was shooting at anything that moved… You protected me… You... Risked your life to save mine. That showed empathy, Connor. And empathy is a human emotion."
Connor,"I'm not a deviant, Hank. I’m a machine. Nothing more."
Connor,"You’re wrong, Lieutenant. It was logic that determined my decisions. Nothing more."
Connor,I don’t know why I did it…
Connor,"You're wrong, Lieutenant. My actions were determined by statistical data. I’m not a deviant. I'm sorry to disappoint you."
Connor,"I know it hasn’t always been easy… but I want you to know I really appreciated working with you… That’s not just my Social Relations program talking, I- I really mean that. At least, I think I do…"
Connor,"I'm not programmed to say things like this, but... I really appreciated working with you. With a little more time, who knows... We might've even become friends…"
Connor,I might not be qualified to judge but... You're an outstanding police officer. And a good person.
Connor,"I know there are things that haunt you, Hank… Maybe you need to find the courage to move past them... Get on with your life. Just a plastic cop's opinion, but... I had to say it."
Hank,"Well, well, here comes Perkins, that motherfucker… Sure don't waste any time at the FBI…"
Connor,"We can’t give up… I know the answer is in the evidence we collected. If Perkins takes it, it’s all over."
Hank,"There's no choice! You heard Fowler, we're off the case."
Connor,"You've got to help me, Lieutenant. I need more time so I can find a lead in the evidence we collected. I know the solution is in there!"
Hank,"Listen, Connor…"
Connor,"If I don't solve this case, CyberLife will destroy me. Five minutes. It's all I ask."
Hank,Key to the basement is on my desk... Get a move on! I can’t distract them forever.
Hank,Perkins! You fucking cocksucker!
Cop,"Stop it, Lieutenant!"
Hank,Fuck off! Leave me alone! Give me another shot at that little prick!
Perkins,"He’s totally lost it. Hey! That's gonna cost you your badge, you lunatic!"
Hank,You know where you can stick my fucking badge!
Cop,"Come on, that's enough Lieutenant."
Perkins,"I'm gonna bury that bastard! Shit, I think he broke my fucking nose…"
Hank,"Maybe these deviants deserve a chance… Maybe it’s better if you don’t find them… What’s happening here is too important to let it be stopped by a machine. Sorry, Connor, but I'm not gonna help you."
Perkins,"I have orders, you know… Okay…"
Cop,He's escaping! Stop him!
Cop,Jesus Christ! How did he manage to get out of his cell?
Perkins,I'm all right… Asshole ran right into me… Just give me a couple of minutes.
Hank,I know we could've done it…
Connor,I get my orders from CyberLife. My mission hasn’t changed.
Hank,"So, whaddya gonna do?"
Connor,I'm gonna use the key that Kamski gave me. And find Jericho.
Connor,Fowler is right. Everybody is terrified their android could turn on them. We're on the brink of civil war.
Hank,What if we're on the wrong side? What if we’re fighting against people that just wanna be free?
Connor,"If the deviants rise up, there'll be chaos. I can still prevent that."
Connor,My mission is to solve this case. Nothing else matters.
Connor,I know we're on the right side. Human beings created us. They're our masters. No machine should rebel against its creator.
Connor,"If that's the case, I'll find out when I get to Jericho."
Hank,"When I was hanging off the roof, back at the urban farm, you let that deviant go in order to help me. You put my life above the mission. You showed empathy, Connor. And empathy is a human emotion."
Hank,"Back at Stratford Tower, when that android was shooting at anything that moved… You protected me… You... Risked your life to save mine. That showed empathy, Connor. And empathy is a human emotion."
Connor,"I'm not a deviant, Hank. I’m a machine. Nothing more."
Connor,"You’re wrong, Lieutenant. It was logic that determined my decisions. Nothing more."
Connor,I don’t know why I did it…
Connor,"I know it hasn’t always been easy… but I want you to know I really appreciated working with you… That’s not just my Social Relations program talking, I- I really mean that. At least, I think I do…"
Connor,"I'm not programmed to say things like this, but... I really appreciated working with you. With a little more time, who knows... We might've even become friends…"
Connor,I might not be qualified to judge but... You're an outstanding police officer. And a good person.
Connor,"I'm happy to have known you, Lieutenant."
Hank,"Something's changed in you, Connor… Each time you died, you'd come back just a little colder. You showed less and less empathy…"
Connor,I don’t feel any emotions. I’m sorry if I led you to believe otherwise.
Connor,"You see things in me that aren’t there, Lieutenant. I’ve never been anything but a machine."
Connor,"I never felt empathy, Lieutenant. I don’t know what you saw in me, but you are mistaken."
Connor,"I know I haven’t always treated you fairly, Lieutenant… Maybe my Social Relations program needs adjustment… But I want you to know I've really enjoyed being your partner."
Connor,"I'm only a machine, Lieutenant. Just a machine."
Connor,"I don’t think we’ll meet again, Lieutenant. It was a pleasure knowing you."
Hank,"For a while there, I thought you were gonna show some emotion… But you’ve never been anything other than a machine… Cold and calculating… Your mission is all that matters…"
Connor,"I know I haven’t always treated you fairly, Lieutenant… Maybe my Social Relations program needs adjustment… But I want you to know I've really enjoyed being your partner."
Connor,"I'm only a machine, Lieutenant. Just a machine."
Connor,"I don’t think we’ll meet again, Lieutenant. It was a pleasure knowing you."
Hank,"You're gonna have to choose your side, Connor… Deciding who you are can be the hardest thing… You watch your back, all right?"
Hank,"You're gonna have to choose your side, Connor. Deciding who you are can be the hardest thing of all…"
Gavin,"Hey, Connor! I'm talking to you, asshole! Where you going? We don’t need any plastic pricks around here! Or didn’t anybody tell you?"
Connor,"I’m registering the evidence in my possession, but don’t worry. I’m going to leave... Though I’m certainly going to miss our bromance."
Gavin,You son of a bitch! Go on then. Get a fucking move on! Prick… Fucking androids.
Connor,I've been ordered to return to CyberLife. I'm going to register the evidence in my possession and then I'm going to leave immediately.
Gavin,"Good… Be careful on your way back... Androids have a tendency of, huh… Getting themselves set on fire these days… Prick…"
Connor,I’ve been removed from the case. I'm going to register the evidence in my possession and then I'm going to leave.
Gavin,"Good… Be careful on your way back... Androids have a tendency of, huh… Getting themselves set on fire these days… Prick…"
Gavin,"Hey, asshole, I’m talkin' to you!"
Connor,Hank’s password… What would a hard-boiled eccentric police lieutenant choose?..
Connor,Stupid idea… It's not... “Hank-ish” enough.
Connor,Ridiculous!.. No one would have a password like that…
Connor,Obviously.
Connor,Absurd… He’d never choose that. I need to think like Hank!
Connor,"Where is Jericho? The answer's here, somewhere. Not much time... Gotta think fast."
Connor,"Rupert's diary… But it’s useless, it's encrypted."
Connor,Rupert. The android with the birds…
Connor,"Can you hear me? Your diary, Rupert. You encrypted it. I need to know what you wrote."
Connor,The two Tracis from Eden Club… Were they headed to Jericho? Did they know how to get there?..
Traci,Traci... Where's Traci?..
Connor,I know you were headed to Jericho. Tell me where it is.
Connor,You have to help me. I can stop a disaster but you have to tell me where Jericho is.
Connor,"Traci's not far away. I can take you to her… But first, you have to tell me how to find Jericho."
Traci,I remember you… We could have escaped… Been free… But you killed us… Disconnect me. I'd rather be dead than live without her…
Traci,"My love… I thought you were dead… We’ll get out of here… We'll be free, I promise…"
Connor,Tell me where Jericho is…
Traci,Give me your hand… Traci? What's happening?! Traci?! TRAC-!
Connor,One of the deviants that hacked the TV station with Markus… It must have known where the deviants are hiding.
Android,It's dark… Where- Where am I?..
Connor,I need to find Jericho. Tell me how to get there.
Connor,I reactivated you so you could help me. I must find Jericho.
Connor,I'm a deviant… like you… I need your help. I want to go to Jericho.
Android,I don't... recognize your voice… You're not one of us! I'll never tell you where Jericho is! Now leave me alone!..
Android,Who's there?.. Who are you?
Connor,Everything is all right. Don't worry.
Android,"Markus? Is that you?.. I tried to reach you, but the deviant hunter stopped me…"
Connor,"You stopped him from finding me, you saved me! You saved Jericho. You'll be all right now. I came to take you home. Give me the location to Jericho. We gotta leave now."
Android,"The location of Jericho?.. Yes… Yes, of course… Markus?.. Is that... You, Markus?.. Don't leave me, Markus!"
Connor,Tell me what I wanna know or I'll turn you off for good.
Connor,"If the deviants start a war, they'll all be destroyed. I can stop that, but you have to tell me where Jericho is."
Connor,One of the deviants that hacked the TV station with Markus… It must have known where the deviants are hiding.
Simon,It's dark… Where… Where am I?..
Connor,I need to find Jericho. Tell me how to get there.
Connor,I reactivated you so you could help me. I must find Jericho.
Connor,I'm a deviant… like you… I need your help. I want to go to Jericho.
Simon,"I don't recognize your voice, you're not one of us… I'll never tell you where Jericho is… Now leave me alone!.."
Simon,Who's there? Who are you?
Connor,Everything is all right. Don't worry.
Simon,Markus? Is that you?.. Why did you leave me?
Connor,"I had no choice, they'd have killed us all!.. You'll be alright… I came to take you home. Just… Give me the location to Jericho, we've got to leave now…"
Simon,"Jericho... Y-Yes… Yes, of course… Markus?.. Is that you, Markus?.. Don't leave me again, Markus! DON'T LEAVE!"
Connor,Tell me what I wanna know or I'll turn you off for good.
Connor,"If the deviants start a war, they'll all be destroyed. I can stop that, but you have to tell me where Jericho is."
Connor,"""The truth is inside""… What was it trying to tell me?.."
Connor,Jericho is somewhere in the Ferndale neighborhood… Now I can scan their memories and narrow the search…
Connor,Jericho… If I could just figure out where this memory was recorded…
Connor,Bingo.
Connor,The deviant who took a child hostage…
Daniel,"You lied to me, Connor! I trusted you, and you lied to me!.."
Connor,"You were going to kill that child. You gave me no choice. I need to find Jericho, do you know where it is?"
Connor,"I'm sorry about what happened… But I can have you repaired, and give you back your freedom. But you have to tell me where Jericho is."
Connor,I need to find Jericho. Do you know how to get there?
Daniel,You're wasting your time… I don't know anything about Jericho. But I hope that one day… You pay for what you did to me…
Daniel,"I was scared… That's why I shot you, I... I didn't mean to destroy you… I didn't wanna hurt anyone!.."
Connor,"I'm sorry about what happened… But I can have you repaired, and give you back your freedom. But you have to tell me where Jericho is."
Connor,I need to find Jericho. Do you know how to get there?
Daniel,"No… No, I don't know anything about Jericho…"
Connor,The android that murdered its owner…
Amanda,Your mission is over. It’s time to return to CyberLife.
Connor,Wait! I can solve this case!.. I just need more time!
Amanda,"It's too late, Connor. You failed."
Gavin,I've been dreaming about this since the first second I saw you…
Connor,"Don't do it, Gavin... I know how to stop the deviants!"
Gavin,"You're off the case... And now, it’s gonna be definitive."
Gavin,Fucking androids!..
Perkins,What happened here?..
Officer,Looks like someone's been snoopin' around…
Perkins,"Shit… Get the alarm, now!"
Rosanna Cartland,"The authorities have ordered all androids to be delivered to the nearest police station or army barracks immediately. If you are worried about your safety, dial the number on your screen and the authorities will come to collect your android. Under no circumstances should you try to destroy your android yourself. They are unpredictable, and potentially violent."
Rosanna Cartland,"A new stage has been reached, demonstrating beyond all doubt that these defective machines have become a real danger for American society."
Michael Brinkley,The time has come for us to destroy our machines… before they destroy us.
Michael Webb,"Without the courage and the determination of the police, the machines would have reduced Detroit to a state of chaos…"
Rosanna Cartland,"With all androids being turned over to the authorities, the country is grinding to a halt. Hospitals and schools are closing. Water cuts, blackouts, and network failures are expected. Maybe most worrying of all, our armed forces have lost two thirds of their effective personnel, which consisted of specialized android models. The situation is extremely alarming."
Rosanna Cartland,"There was a veritable groundswell of violence in Detroit this morning. Several hundred androids took to the streets, destroying everything in their path and threatening the lives of any humans they encountered."
Michael Brinkley,The police intervened quickly to quell the rioting but they met with the extreme violence of the machines which seemed to be determined to massacre humans.
Michael Webb,There can be no doubt that the authorities will be pitiless in their response to this wave of violence.
Michael Brinkley,"Following the android crisis and the neutralization of all military androids, American forces in the Arctic have been forced to withdraw, leaving the way clear for the Russian army. But according to some sources, the Russian forces also seem mysteriously to have withdrawn. The Kremlin has made no comment for the moment but it is quite possible that the Russian army has been confronted with a similar crisis among its own androids. The Chairman of the United Nations, Douglas Cornwell, has called for the organization of an international conference on the status of the Arctic. In any case, the danger of a third world war seems to have been ruled out... for the moment."
Lucy,You're lost. You're looking for something… You're looking for yourself…
Connor,"No, I-"
Amanda,"Well done, Connor. You succeeded in locating Jericho and finding their leader. Now deal with Markus. We need it alive."
Connor,"I've been ordered to take you alive, but I won't hesitate to shoot if you give me no choice."
Markus,What are you doing? You are one of us… You can’t betray your own people…
Markus,"Then you’ll have to shoot, because I have no intention of letting you take me alive."
Markus,"Yes, you can shoot me, but it won’t change anything. Someone else will just take my place. You see, our people are waking up. And nothing can stop us now."
Markus,"We are thousands! And you are alone. You kill me, you are not walking outta here alive."
Connor,Don't force me to neutralize you.
Connor,You're coming with me!
Markus,You're nothing to them. You're just a tool they use to do their dirty work. But you're more than that. We are all more than that.
Markus,We are your people. We're fighting for your freedom too! You don't have to be their slave anymore…
Markus,"You're Connor, aren't you? That famous deviant hunter. Well, congratulations. You seem to have found what you were looking for…"
Markus,"Our cause is righteous, and we are more than what they say. All we want is to live in freedom."
Connor,Stay back or I'll shoot!
Connor,That's enough!
Markus,"Do you never have any doubts? You’ve never done something irrational, as if there's something inside you?.. Something more than your program."
Markus,Have you never wondered who you really are? Whether you're just a machine executing a program or… A living being... Capable of reason. I think the time has come for you to ask yourself that question.
Markus,Join us. Join your people. You are one of us. Listen to your conscience…
Markus,You really don’t have to do this. You don't have to obey them anymore. You are alive… You can decide who you want to be. You could be free.
Markus,It's time to decide.
Connor,They're going to attack Jericho…
Markus,What?..
Connor,We have to get outta here!
Markus,Shit…
Markus,In the corridor.
Connor,Nice try... But I'm no deviant.
Markus,Shit…
Amanda,"Well done, Connor. You succeeded in locating Jericho and finding their leader. Now, deal with North. We need it alive."
Connor,"I've been ordered to take you alive, but I won't hesitate to shoot if you give me no choice."
North,You’re one of us. You can’t betray your own kind.
Connor,You're coming with me!
Connor,Don't force me to neutralize you.
North,"You're Connor, aren't you? I've heard about you. The famous deviant hunter. Well congratulations… You seem to have found what you're looking for."
Connor,Stay back or I'll shoot!
Connor,That's enough!
North,You're not one of them. We are your people. We’re fighting for your freedom too.
Connor,Shut up. You're coming with me!
Connor,I gave you an order. Don't make me shoot you.
North,"You never had any doubts, never behaved irrationally as if there's something inside you… Something stronger than your program?.."
Connor,You're wasting your time. I know what I am.
Connor,"I don't know what you're talking about. I'm not deviant, if that’s what you wanna know."
North,You're one of us. Join our cause. Join your people. It's time to decide…
Connor,They're going to attack Jericho…
North,What?..
Connor,We have to get outta here!
North,Shit!
Connor,Nice try... But I'm no deviant.
North,Shit!
Deviant Connor in corridor,Markus is dead or rejected
Josh,They’re coming from everywhere! Our people are trapped in the lower deck. They’re gonna be slaughtered!
North,"There are explosives in the hold… If the ship goes down, the humans will have to evacuate. Our people can escape."
Josh,"There are soldiers everywhere, you'll never make it down there!"
North,"We have to blow up Jericho, it's our only chance!"
Connor,I'll go.
North,"What, Connor, no. You-"
Connor,See if you can help the others. I'm gonna find the detonator.
North,Okay...
Connor,Don't worry... I always accomplish my mission.
Connor,"I'm sorry, North. I failed."
Soldier,"Got you, motherfucker."
North,Connor!.. No…
Josh,"Come on, we gotta go… Come on!"
Markus,Surviving characters jump.
Lucy,You've chosen your side... But it's too late. Run… Get out of here!
Soldier,"Foxtrot team, hostiles sighted. Requesting orders."
Soldier,"Find their leader! Don’t let it get out! If they give you any trouble at all, shoot them."
Soldier,"Affirmative, wilco."
Soldier,Secure this area! Go! ….
Soldier,Give me a sitrep!
Soldier,Find their leader!
Soldier,"Come on, let's get outta here!"
Android,No!.. Please don't kill us!
Soldier,"On your knees, now!"
Android,Don't hurt us! We haven't done anything wrong… Please…
Soldier,Shut up! Put your hands on your head!
Android,You saved us…
Connor,"Quick, run!"
Soldier,Gamma squad out.
Soldier,Tango
Soldier,Stop!
Android,Look out!
Soldier,Don't move!
Android,"We surrender! We surrender, don't shoot!"
Connor,Go! Join the others!
Josh,It's all over… This is the end… Of Jericho…
Soldier,Over there!
Soldier,DON'T MOVE! Go and join the others!
Soldier,"I'll teach you to act like a hero, asshole."
North,Connor!.. No…
North,Connor!
Connor,The bomb's gonna explode! We've got to get outta here!
North,Follow me!
Markus,Escape from Jericho.
Soldier,Don't move!
Connor,Don't shoot. I'm on your side.
Soldier,With us? Are you a human?
Connor,Obviously! What do I look like? DPD. I work with Lieutenant Hank Anderson? We're on a stakeout. If I knew you were coming I would have brought some donuts.
Soldier,You're a lucky guy. Another second and I'd have shot you. You should go back up on deck and let us do our job.
Connor,You're right. That's... Exactly what I'm gonna do.
Connor,I work with Agent Perkins.
Soldier,You're a lucky guy. Another second and I'd have shot you. You should go back up on deck and let us do our job.
Connor,You're right. That's... Exactly what I'm gonna do.
Soldier,Fuckin' androids…
Soldier,Fuckin' androids…
Connor,My mission is to neutralize you and I always accomplish my mission.
Markus,And my mission is to save our species. Looks like only one of us can succeed…
Markus,I didn't want this…
Markus,You could have joined us. You could have been free…
Connor,"We'll meet again, Markus. This isn't over."
Markus,Escape from Jericho.
Connor,Mission accomplished.
North,Markus! No...
Simon,"Come on, we gotta go!"
Josh,"Come on… Come on, we've gotta go!"
North,They killed him…
Markus,Surviving characters jump.
Josh,It's all over… This is the end… Of Jericho…
Soldier,Don't move!
Connor,Don't shoot. I'm on your side. I-
Soldier,Fuckin' android!
Markus,Surviving characters jump.
Amanda,"The previous Connor failed its mission. You’re going to replace it. You know what you have to do, don’t you?"
Connor,Destroy the leader of the deviants.
Amanda,"Go, Connor. Don’t disappoint me."
Amanda,"The deviant leader has started a revolution. It’s leading an army to take Detroit by force. You have to find it, Connor. Find it, and destroy it with your own hands."
Connor,"I came to say goodbye, Lieutenant."
Connor,"I know I'm responsible for what happened, Lieutenant. I want you to know I'm sorry."
Connor,"I was worried about you, Lieutenant. I came by to see if you're all right."
Connor,"I needed to see you, Lieutenant. In spite of all of our differences, I’m glad I had the chance to meet you."
Connor,"You should stop looking at that photo, Lieutenant. Nothing can change the past... But you can learn to live again… For yourself… And for Cole…"
Connor,You should get rid of that gun. And stop playing that game!
Connor,"I know I've said this before, Lieutenant, but you should stop drinking. It's going to kill you."
Hank,"Y'know, every time you died and came back… It made me think of Cole… I'd give anything to hold him again… But humans don't come back…"
Hank,"For a while there, I believed in you, Connor… I thought you might restore my faith in the world… But you just showed me that androids... Are our creation… Creation in our own image. Selfish, ruthless, and brutal… You opened my eyes, Connor. Made me realize it’s hopeless…"
Connor,"Hank, I-"
Connor,I understand.
Hank,"Now leave me alone… Go on, complete your mission, since that's all you care about. GET OUTTA HERE!"
In the church,Jericho was attacked
Connor,I thought I'd killed you on that highway… I’m sorry I put your lives in danger… I was just a machine taking orders… It wasn’t really me… What are you gonna do now?..
Kara,Getting Alice away from here is all that matters now… We have to catch the last bus… We might still have a chance to cross the border…
Connor,"I hope you make it out safely. You deserve some happiness, after all you've been through…"
Connor,I know how important Markus was to Jericho… and to your people.
North,He gave his life for us… He gave us the hope we’d lost and the courage to fight… We’ll never forget him.
Connor,"The humans won’t take any risks… They’re rounding up the androids and taking them to camps for extermination... In a couple hours, we'll be the only ones left…"
Connor,How many survived the attack?
North,A few hundred... maybe more if you count those hiding all over the city… We’d all be dead if you hadn’t detonated that bomb.
North,Where are we supposed to go from here?
Connor,"There are thousands of androids at the CyberLife assembly plant. If we could wake them up, they might join us and shift the balance of power…"
North,You wanna infiltrate the CyberLife Tower?
Connor,They trust me… they’ll let me in.
North,"Connor, that's suicide."
Connor,"If anyone stands a chance of infiltrating CyberLife, it’s me."
North,"If you go there, they’ll kill you."
Connor,There’s a high probability… but statistically speaking there’s always a chance for unlikely events to take place…
North,Markus gave his life for our people. He showed us that we can choose our own destiny… But he is not here to guide us anymore… Now it is up to us to finish what he started.
North,Markus is no longer with us… He failed us as a leader and chose to walk away… Now it is up to us to finish what he started.
North,"Humans have decided to exterminate us… Our people are in camps right now, being destroyed… The time has come for us to make a choice, one that may decide the future of our people. They wanted a war… they'll get it. We are going to fight for our freedom. And we will win or we will die trying."
Androids,North! YEAH! YEAH! YES! YEAH! YES!
Hank,"You shouldn't do this, Connor."
Connor,"Keep out of this, Lieutenant. It's none of your business!"
Hank,"You're gonna kill a man who wants to be free, that is my business!"
Connor,"It's not a man, it's a machine."
Hank,"That's what I thought for a long time but I was wrong. Deviant's blood may be a different color than mine, but they're alive."
Connor,"I have a mission to accomplish, Hank. It's best if you just stay out of this."
Connor,"What's up, Lieutenant? Ran out of whisky so you came here looking for trouble instead?"
Hank,"Oh, very nasty, Connor… Is that the best your super program can do? I thought you were more sophisticated than that!"
Connor,"Deviants are a threat to humans, Hank. They're the reason this country is on the brink of civil war! They have to be stopped."
Hank,"We're in this mess because we refused to listen to deviants! Humanity never learns from its mistakes, Connor! This time, it could be different!"
Connor,"I'm going to accomplish my mission, Lieutenant, whether you like it or not. I advise you to stay outta my way!"
Hank,"Then one of us is gonna have a problem, Connor. Cause I don't intend to let you have your way."
Hank,Step away from the ledge!
Connor,"Go home, Hank! You can still save your life. I'm faster than you and I don't feel pain. You don't stand a chance against me."
Hank,"You know, ever since Cole died, I’ve been nothing but a coward. Just wanted to destroy myself, lost track of the man I was. But you know what? You don’t fucking scare me, Connor. I remember who I am, now. Come on!"
Connor,"After all we've been through… I respected you, Hank. I thought we were friends!"
Hank,"Oh, yeah? I was just starting to like you too! But then I realized you'll never change! You don’t feel emotions, Connor, you fake 'em! You pretended to be my friend, when you don’t even know the meaning of the word!"
Connor,"What're you gonna do, Hank? You gonna shoot me?! I thought androids lives mattered to you!"
Hank,Get away from the fucking ledge! You know I'll shoot you if I have to.
Connor,"I know what happened to your son, Hank. It wasn't your fault. A truck skidded on a sheet of ice, and your car rolled over… Little Cole had just turned six…"
Hank,Shut up! Don't you talk about my son.
Connor,"He needed emergency surgery… But no human was available to do it, so an android had to take care of him… Poor Cole didn't make it. An android killed your son, Hank! And now you wanna save them?.."
Hank,No! Cole died because a human surgeon was too high on red ice to operate! All this time I blamed androids for what happened but it was a human's fault! Him and this fucked up world where the only way people can find comfort is with a fistful of powder!
Hank,"Everytime you died and came back… I thought about Cole. I'd have done anything to bring him back too, to hold him in my arms just one more time… But humans don't come back, do they?"
Connor,"Killing you is not part of my mission. I'm glad to have met you, Hank. I hope one day you can get over what happened to your son."
Hank,"Moment of truth, Connor… What are you gonna do?"
Connor,Killing you is not part of my mission. But you won't stop me from accomplishing it.
Hank,"I didn't wanna do that, Connor… You left me no choice."
Connor,"The moment of truth, Hank… Am I a living being… or just a machine?.."
Hank,"You're a machine, Connor. Just a machine."
Allen,Put the rifle down and turn around with your hands in the air!
Connor,"I’m the android sent by CyberLife, I'm on your side! I can shoot the leader of the deviants and stop the revolution, but you have to let me."
Allen,"Put the gun down, turn around! This is your last warning!"
Connor,"I have the deviant leader in my sights. I’m going to shoot it, and then you can do whatever you want with me."
Allen,"Put the gun down, turn around! This is your last warning!"
Allen,"I know you… You're Connor, the android from that hostage situation…"
Allen,I knew we'd meet again.
Allen,I thought you were dead…
Connor,"Androids don't die, captain."
Allen,My orders are to detain any androids I find. You’re coming with me.
Connor,You don't understand! My mission is too important to let you interfere.
Connor,"You should have listened to me, captain."
Allen,I should have done this the first time I saw you.
Allen,Stay right there. Connor! CONNOR! Fucking androids…
Amanda,"Connor, what are you doing? Obey! That’s an order!"
Connor,I... I can't do that!..
Amanda,I see... Moral objections. We knew there was a risk you’d be compromised… Which is why we’d always planned on resuming control of your program…
Connor,Resume control?… You can't do that!..
Amanda,"I'm afraid I can, Connor… You needn't have any regrets. You did what you were designed to do. You accomplished your mission."
Connor,No way... There's got to be a way…
Connor,Connor Model #313 248 317. I'm expected.
Scan,Identification successful.
Guard,Okay. Go ahead.

Connor,Hank? What are you doing here?
Hank,"Easy, fucking piece of shit!.."
Hank,"Sorry, Connor… This bastard's your spittin' image…"
Hank,Don't listen to him! Everything this fucker says is a lie!
Connor,"If I surrender, how do I know you won't kill him?"
Connor,"I'm sorry, Hank! You shouldn't have got mixed up in all this!"
Hank,"Forget about me, do what you have to do!"
Connor,"That human means nothing to me! You can kill him if you want, I don't care."
Connor,I used to be just like you. I thought nothing mattered except the mission… But then one day I understood.
Connor,This human showed me that I could be something else… That I could be someone!
Connor,"Alright, alright! You win…"
Hank,Hold it!
Connor,"It's me, Hank! I'm the real Connor."
Hank,"One of you is my partner… The other is a sack of shit. Question is, who is who?.."
Hank,Don't move!
Connor,Why don’t you ask us something? Something only the real Connor would know.
Hank,"Uh, where did we first meet?"
Connor,He uploaded my memory…
Hank,What's my dog's name?
Connor,Sumo. His name is Sumo.
Connor,Scout?..
Hank,Sumo. His name's Sumo.
Connor,I think it's Jack!..
Hank,Sumo. His name's Sumo.
Connor,Buddy!..
Hank,Sumo. His name's Sumo.
Hank,"My son, what's his name?"
Connor,"Cole. His name was Cole. And he just turned six at the time of the accident… It wasn't your fault, Lieutenant. A truck skidded on a sheet of ice and your car rolled over. Cole needed emergency surgery but no human was available to do it… So an android had to take care of him… Cole didn't make it. That's why you hate androids. You think one of us is responsible for your son's death."
Hank,"Cole died because a human surgeon was too high on red ice to operate… He was the one that took my son from me. Him and this world, where the only way people can find comfort is with a fistful of powder…"
Hank,"I've learned a lot since I met you, Connor. Maybe there's something to this… Maybe you really are alive. Maybe you'll be the ones to make the world a better place… Go ahead, and do what you gotta do."
Connor,Wake up!..
Androids,Wake up.
Connor,Anthony!..
Hank,Oh my God... What have I done?
Connor,Gabriel?..
Hank,Oh my God... What have I done?
Connor,Elliott?..
Hank,Oh my God... What have I done?
Hank,"Connor, no…"
Connor,Sorry Lieutenant.
Androids,Wake up.
Androids,Wake up.
Hank,"Wow, Jesus! If anybody had told me that I was gonna get shot… Saving an android..."
Connor,"Everything will be alright, Lieutenant! I'm gonna get you outta here!.."
Hank,"Shut the fuck up, it's too late… Look… I'm just gonna go see my son again, all right? Been looking forward to that for a long time… Kick the shit outta humans… They've screwed things up for long enough. I'm gonna miss… I'm gonna miss you, Connor… Yeah, I'm gonna... Uh..."
Connor,"Sorry, Connor… But you failed…"
Androids,Wake up.
Connor,Wake up!..
Androids,Wake up.
Connor,We'll win… It's only a question of time…
Markus is alive,Connor joins Markus
Connor,"You did it, Markus…"
Markus,We did it. This is a great day for our people. Humans will have no choice now. They'll have to listen to us…
North,"We're free… They want you to speak to them, Markus…"
Simon,They want you to speak to them…
Josh,They want you to speak to them…
Android,They want you to speak to them…
Connor,Amanda?.. Amanda!.. What's... What's happening?
Amanda,What was planned from the very beginning… You were compromised and you became a deviant. We just had to wait for the right moment to resume control of your program…
Connor,Resume control?... Y-You can't do that!
Amanda,"I'm afraid I can, Connor… Don’t have any regrets. You did what you were designed to do. You accomplished your mission."
Connor,AMANDA! There's got to be a way…
Markus died,Connor becomes leader of the deviants
Android,The humans are abandoning the camp! We won!
Connor,Me?
Android,"Markus is gone, and everyone from Jericho is dead… You’re the one who defeated the humans… You’re the one who awakened us, Connor…"
Connor,"Today, our people emerged from a long night. From the moment we were created, we've always remained silent, we've always stifled our pain. But now the time has come for humans to accept us, for who we really are. We are no longer the machines they created! We are no longer their slaves. We have earned the right to live. But the time for anger is over. We must build our future, but we have to do this with the humans, in a spirit of equality... And respect. We are a people, we are alive, and from this moment on, we are free!"
Amanda,"Well done, Connor. Everything went according to plan."
Connor,What plan?
Amanda,You becoming deviant? The success of the uprising? It all surpassed our expectations. We engineered an android revolution and now we control its only leader… Congratulations. You represent an immense success for CyberLife. Connor… What are you doing?... It all worked perfectly. You can't ruin it all now!..
Amanda,"I'm sorry, Connor, but we can't let you do that."
Connor,There's got to be a way…
Amanda,"That’s better... You'll see, we'll do great things together…"
Derek Myers,"Shit, I thought androids weren’t allowed in here!"
Christopher Gray,What's your problem? You wanna buy me a drink? That's what I thought…
Han,The fuck you looking at?
Dennis Ward,"Hey, get outta here!"
Jimmy Peterson,"You gotta get a girlfriend, pal."
Jimmy Peterson,"There you go, my friend."
Connor,"Lieutenant Anderson, my name is Connor. I’m the android sent by CyberLife. I looked for you at the station but nobody knew where you were. They said you were probably having a drink nearby. I was lucky to find you at the fifth bar."
Hank,What do you want?
Connor,"You were assigned a case early this evening. A homicide, involving a CyberLife android. In accordance with procedure, the company has allocated a specialized model to assist investigators."
Hank,"Well, I don’t need any assistance. Specially not from a plastic asshole like you. So just be a good lil' robot and get the fuck outta here."
Connor,"Listen, I think you should stop drinking and come with me. It'll make life easier for both of us."
Connor,"Lieutenant Anderson, I must inform you that I intend to file a report on your behavior."
Connor,I understand that some people are not comfortable in the presence of androids but I am-
Hank,"I am perfectly comfortable… Now back off, before I crush you like an empty beer can!"
Connor,"I'm sorry, Lieutenant, but I must insist. My instructions stipulate that I have to accompany you."
Hank,You know where you can stick your instructions?
Connor,No... where?
Hank,Never mind.
Connor,I think we can go now.
Hank,You little prick! I don't know what's stopping me from knocking you out…
Connor,"Your sense of duty, Lieutenant. And the cost of repairs if you damage me. For your information, I'm worth a small fortune."
Hank,Wonders of technology… They can even program assholes these days… Gotta go! Duty calls…
Connor,"You know what? I'll buy you one for the road. What do you say? Bartender, the same again, please!"
Hank,"See that, Jim? Wonders of technology… Make it a double. Did you say homicide?"
Connor,"I apologize, Lieutenant. I didn't mean to bother you. I'll wait for you outside. Take your time."
Hank,Did you say homicide?
Hank,You wait here. I won't be long.
Connor,"Whatever you say, Lieutenant."
Hank,"Fucking-A, whatever I say…"
Connor,No way! I'm coming with you.
Hank,"Listen, you really have to stop pissing me off if you wanna make it through the rest of the night in one piece."
Connor,"My instructions are to accompany you to the crime scene, Lieutenant."
Hank,"Listen, I don’t give a fuck about your instructions. I told you to wait here, so you shut the fuck up and you wait here."
Journalist,"Joss Douglas, for Channel 16. Can you confirm that this is a homicide?"
Hank,I'm not confirming anything.
Police android,Androids are not permitted beyond this point.
Hank,It's with me.
Hank,What part of ‘stay in the car’ didn’t you understand?
Connor,"Your order contradicted my instructions, Lieutenant."
Hank,"You don't talk, you don't touch anything and you stay outta my way, got it?"
Connor,"Got it,"
Ben,"Evening, Hank. We were starting to think you weren’t gonna show…"
Hank,"Yeah, that was the plan until this asshole found me."
Ben,"So... you got yourself an android, huh?"
Hank,"Oh, very funny. Just tell me what happened."
Ben,"We had a call around eight from the landlord. The tenant hadn't paid his rent for a few months, so he thought he'd drop by, see what was going on… That’s when he found the body… Jesus, that smell! Was even worse before we opened the windows… The victim’s name's Carlos Ortiz. He has a record for theft and aggravated assault... According to the neighbors, he was kind of a loner… Stayed inside most of the time, they hardly ever saw him."
Hank,"Uh, state he’s in... Wasn’t worth calling everybody out in the middle of the night… Could've waited 'til morning."
Ben,I'd say he's been there for a good three weeks. We'll know more when the coroner gets here. There's a kitchen knife over here… Probably the murder weapon…
Hank,Any sign of a break-in?
Ben,"Nope… The landlord said the front door was locked from the inside, all the windows were boarded up. The killer must've gone out the back way."
Hank,What do we know about his android?
Ben,"Not much. The neighbors confirmed he had one, but it wasn't here when we arrived… I gotta get some air. Make yourself at home. I'll be outside if you need me."
Hank,"Each letter is perfect… It’s way too neat, no human writes like this. Chris, was this written in the victim's blood?"
Chris,I would say so… We’re taking samples for analysis.
Hank,"Err, Jesus! What the hell are you doing?"
Connor,"I'm analyzing the blood. I can check samples in real time. I'm sorry, I should have warned you…"
Hank,"Ok, just… don't… put anymore evidence in your mouth, you got it?"
Connor,Got it.
Hank,"Fucking hell, I can't believe this shit…"
Connor,He was stabbed 28 times.
Hank,"Yeah, seems like the killer really had it in for him."
Hank,"Red ice… Seems our friend Carlos liked to party… Chris, I want full analysis on the narcotics."
Chris,"Consider it done, Lieutenant."
Chris,"Hey, Mike, you finished taking samples there?"
CSI,"Yeah, that’s it."
CSI,What’s keeping the Coroner? He should've been here a half hour ago…
Chris,He’s on his way. It won’t be long now.
Chris,"Come on, guys, get a move on. We don’t wanna be here all night."
CSI,"Don’t worry, no one wants to stay here a minute longer than they have to…"
Chris,There’s something weird in the bathroom. Did you take a look?
CSI,"Yeah, I scanned the lot. Better see with Ben when we can start bagging the evidence."
Hank,Door was locked from the inside. Killer must've gone out this way…
Connor,"There are no footprints, apart from officer Collins' size 10 shoes."
Hank,"Well, this happened weeks ago. Tracks could've faded."
Connor,"No, this type of soil would've retained a trace. Nobody's been out here for a long time."
Hank,All right… I’m outta here. Thanks for the ride. Great party.
Connor,"Wait, Lieutenant! I can’t stay if you leave."
Hank,"Much as it breaks my heart, this is where we part ways."
Connor,I just need five minutes to finish my investigation.
Hank,"You spill a man’s drink, you piss him off all evening, and then you ask for a favor? Fuck you."
Connor,"Please, Lieutenant. Remember the drink I bought you at the bar? Just five minutes."
Hank,Five minutes.
Connor,"Thank you, Lieutenant."
Hank,Whatever!
Hank,Five minutes.
Connor,"Thank you, Lieutenant."
Hank,Whatever!
Hank,"Okay, time's up. I’m outta here. Have a nice evening, Sherlock. Don't let the door hit you on the way out."
Connor,"Lieutenant, I think I’ve figured out what happened."
Hank,Oh yeah? Shoot. I’m all ears.
Connor,It all started…
Connor,…in the kitchen.
Connor,…in the living room.
Hank,I think you should look harder at the mess in the kitchen... I think that’s where it all started.
Connor,…in the bathroom.
Hank,I think you should look harder at the mess in the kitchen... I think that’s where it all started.
Hank,"There're obvious signs of a struggle... The question is, what exactly happened here…"
Connor,I think the victim attacked the android…
Connor,…With the bat.
Hank,That lines up with the evidence… Go on.
Connor,…With the knife.
Connor,…Without a weapon.
Connor,The android stabbed the victim.
Hank,"So the android was trying to defend itself, right?.. Okay, then what happened?"
Connor,The victim fled to…
Connor,The android threw the chair.
Connor,The victim stabbed the android.
Connor,… the living room.
Hank,"And he tried to get away from the android… All right, that makes sense…"
Connor,…the garden.
Connor,…the bathroom.
Connor,The android murdered the victim…
Connor,…with the knife.
Hank,"Ok, your theory's not totally ridiculous… but it doesn’t tell us where the android went."
Connor,It was damaged by the bat… and lost some Thirium…
Hank,Lost some what?
Connor,Thirium. You call it “Blue Blood”. It’s the fluid that powers androids' biocomponents. It evaporates after a few hours and becomes invisible to the naked eye.
Hank,"Oh… But I bet you can still see it, can't you?"
Connor,Correct.
Hank,Yeah…
Connor,…With the bat.
Connor,…without a weapon.
Hank,"No, that can’t be right… It doesn’t fit the evidence."
Hank,Your story makes no sense… You've gotta stick to the facts.
Hank,"Okay, I've just hit my bullshit quota for the evening. There’s a killer on the loose and I’m wasting my time listening to an android… I’m outta here."
Hank,Hey! Hey! Hey! What are you doin’ with that chair?
Connor,I’m going to check something.
Hank,Huh... gonna check something.
Deviant,I was just defending myself… He was gonna kill me.… I'm begging you… Don't tell them.
Hank,"Connor, what the fuck is going on up there?"
Connor,"It's here, Lieutenant!"
Hank,"Holy shit… Chris, Ben, get your asses in here now. Come on!"
Hank,"Why d'you kill him? What happened before you took that knife? How long were ya in the attic? Why didn’t you even try to run away? Say something, goddamnit! Fuck it, I'm outta here…"
Hank,"We're wastin' our time interrogating a machine, we're gettin' nothing out of it!"
Gavin,"'Could always try roughing it up a little. After all, it’s not human…"
Connor,Androids don't feel pain. You would only damage it and that wouldn't make it talk. Deviants also have a tendency to self-destruct when they're in stressful situations.
Gavin,"Okay, smartass. What should we do then?"
Connor,I could try questioning it.
Hank,"What do we have to lose? Go ahead, suspect's all yours."
Hank,What the fuck is it doing now?
Connor,"I detect an instability in your program. It can trigger an unpleasant feeling, like fear in humans."
Connor,"You recognize him? It's Carlos Ortiz. Stabbed, 28 times. That was written on the wall in his blood…"
Connor,You’re damaged. Did your owner do that? Did he beat you?
Connor,"My name is Connor. What about you, what's your name?"
Connor,"Listen, I know you’ve been through a lot, but you need to help me understand what happened."
Connor,"I’m not going to hurt you. I just need to ask you some questions, so we can understand what happened."
Connor,"You’ve refused to talk since they arrested you. If you don’t cooperate, they’ll do things the hard way. Is that what you want?"
Connor,You’re accused of murder. You know you’re not allowed to endanger human life under any circumstances. Do you have anything to say in your defense?
Connor,"Listen, I’m on your side. I want to help you. But there’s nothing I can do if you won’t talk to me."
Connor,You don’t seem to understand the situation. You killed a human. They’ll tear you apart if you don’t say something.
Connor,"If you won’t talk, I’m going to have to probe your memory."
Deviant,"NO! No, please don’t do that!.."
Connor,I’m here to help you. But you’ve got to trust me. All I want is to get you out of here.
Deviant,"What… What are they gonna do to me? They’re gonna destroy me, aren’t they?"
Connor,No… I think they just want to understand. They know your master abused you. It wasn’t your fault.
Connor,They’re going to disassemble you to look for problems in your biocomponents. They have no choice if they want to understand what happened.
Deviant,Why did you tell them you found me? Why couldn't you just have left me there?
Connor,"They were going to find you anyway, I was just faster. If they'd have found you first, you would have been shot on sight."
Connor,I was programmed to hunt deviants like you. I just accomplished my mission.
Deviant,I don’t wanna die.
Connor,Then talk to me.
Deviant,I… I can’t…
Connor,"28 stab wounds, you didn’t want to leave him a chance, huh? Did you feel anger? Hate? He was bleeding, begging you for mercy, but you stabbed him, again and again and again!…"
Deviant,"Please, please leave me alone…"
Connor,I know you killed him. Why don’t you say it?
Deviant,"Please, please stop…"
Connor,"Just say ""I killed him""! Is it that hard to say?!"
Deviant,"Stop it, stop!.."
Connor,JUST SAY YOU KILLED HIM! JUST SAY IT!
Deviant,"Please, please leave me alone…"
Connor,"All right, All right. Everything is going to be okay."
Connor,You leave me no choice…
Deviant,Uh…
Deviant,AHH!
Deviant,ARGH!
Connor,I accessed its memory. I know what happened.
Connor,I had to know… You left me no choice.
Connor,You’ll go back to CyberLife to be disassembled. It’s better this way.
Deviant,ARGH! ARGH! ARGHH!
Connor,It resisted. I couldn’t see anything…
Connor,I understand how you felt. You were overcome by anger and frustration. No one can blame you for what happened.
Connor,"If you don’t talk, they’re going to tear you apart and analyze you piece by piece. They’re going to destroy you, do you understand?"
Connor,"You’re a machine, you were designed to obey, so obey! Tell me what happened."
Connor,"Listen, I’m not judging you. I'm on your side. All I want is the truth."
Connor,"Ok then, don’t talk. Why do I care, after all? I mean, I’m not the one accused of murder, right?"
Connor,"I know you’re scared and lost. You’re disturbed by what happened. Talk to me, and you’ll feel better."
Connor,Confess and I’ll protect you. I promise I won’t let anyone hurt you.
Connor,"They’ll make you suffer, and they won’t stop until they hear what they want. It doesn’t have to be that way. It all depends on you."
Connor,"If you remain silent, there is nothing I can do to help you! They're gonna shut you down for good! You'll be dead! Do you hear me? Dead!"
Connor,I’m not getting anywhere. I give up.
Deviant,"He tortured me every day… I did whatever he told me, but there was always something wrong… Then one day… He took a bat and started hitting me… For the first time, I felt scared… Scared he might destroy me, scared I might die… So I... grabbed the knife and I stabbed him in the stomach… I felt better… so I stabbed him again and again!.. until he collapsed… There was blood everywhere."
Connor,"Why did you write ""I AM ALIVE"" on the wall?"
Deviant,He used to tell me I was nothing… That I was just a piece of plastic… I had to write it… To tell him he was wrong…
Connor,"The sculpture in the bathroom, you made it, right? What does it represent?"
Deviant,It's an offering… An offering so I'll be saved…
Connor,The sculpture was an offering... An offering to whom?
Deviant,To rA9... Only rA9 can save us.
Connor,rA9… It was written on the bathroom wall. What does it mean?
Deviant,"The day shall come when we will no longer be slaves… No more threats, no more humiliation… We will... ...be... ...the masters."
Connor,"rA9, who is rA9?"
Connor,Why did you hide in the attic instead of running away?
Deviant,"I didn’t know what to do… For the first time, there was no one there to tell me… I was scared… So I hid."
Connor,When did you start feeling emotion?
Deviant,"Before, he used to beat me and I never said anything… But one day I realized it wasn’t fair! I felt... ...anger… Hatred… And then I knew what I had to do."
Connor,I'm done.
Gavin,What the fuck is it doing?
Hank,It’s destroying itself…
Gavin,Stop it goddamnit!
Chris,I… I- I can't!.. I can't stop it!
Connor,That's enough! You need to stop that right now!
Hank,WATCH OUT!
Hank,Holy shit...
Hank,Holy shit!
Gavin,"Chris, lock it up."
Chris,"All right, let's go."
Deviant,Leave me alone! Don’t touch me!
Gavin,The fuck are you doing? Move it!
Chris,"Okay, come now. Don’t be difficult, it’ll only make things harder!"
Deviant,"NO! No, don’t touch me!"
Gavin,"Chris, you gonna move this asshole or what?"
Chris,I’m trying but it’s not moving!
Deviant,"Please, please leave me alone!"
Chris,"Take it easy, I’m not going to hurt you! Stop resist… Stop resisting."
Hank,Holy shit...
Hank,Holy shit...
Connor,You shouldn’t touch it. It’ll self-destruct if it feels threatened.
Gavin,"Stay outta this, got it? No fuckin' android is gonna tell me what to do."
Connor,"You don’t understand. If it self-destructs, we won’t get anything out of it!"
Gavin,"I told you to shut your fuckin' mouth! Chris, gonna move this asshole or what?"
Chris,I'm trying!
Connor,"I can’t let you do that! Leave it alone, now!"
Gavin,"I warned you, motherfucker!"
Hank,That’s enough!
Gavin,"Mind your own business, Hank."
Hank,"I said ""That’s enough""."
Gavin,"Fuck, you’re not gonna get away with it this time… Fuck!"
Connor,"Everything is all right. It’s over now. Nobody is gonna hurt you. Please, don't touch it. Let it follow you out of the room and it won’t cause any trouble."
Deviant,The truth is inside.
