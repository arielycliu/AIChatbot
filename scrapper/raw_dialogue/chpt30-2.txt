Markus didn't attack the police in Freedom March

KNC - Rosanna Cartland: The authorities have ordered all androids to be delivered to the nearest police station or army barracks immediately. If you are worried about your safety, dial the number on your screen and the authorities will come to collect your android. Under no circumstances should you try to destroy your android yourself. They are unpredictable, and potentially violent.
Channel 16 - Interviewee 1: The androids weren't doing any harm… And the cops just... gunned them down. It was sheer carnage…
Channel 16 - Interviewee 2: There were androids all over the square. A-and then the police arrived, and, huh… They opened fire.
Channel 16 - Interviewee 3: I know they're only machines, but they… They look like... Just- People! People who wanna be free!
KNC - Rosanna Cartland: A new stage has been reached, demonstrating beyond all doubt that these defective machines have become a real danger for American society.
CTN TV - Michael Brinkley: The time has come for us to destroy our machines… before they destroy us.
Channel 16 - Michael Webb: Without the courage and the determination of the police, the machines would have reduced Detroit to a state of chaos…

Markus attacked the police in Freedom March

KNC - Rosanna Cartland: With all androids being turned over to the authorities, the country is grinding to a halt. Hospitals and schools are closing. Water cuts, blackouts, and network failures are expected. Maybe most worrying of all, our armed forces have lost two thirds of their effective personnel, which consisted of specialized android models. The situation is extremely alarming.
Channel 16 - Interviewee 1: It's them or us. We gotta destroy these bastards before they kill all of us!
Channel 16 - Interviewee 2: We soaked the thing and then we torched it! I mean, to think this fucker was watchin' over my kids!
Channel 16 - Interviewee 3: They, they rushed the police and... They slaughtered them! Those things are monsters! Monsters, I tell you!
KNC - Rosanna Cartland: There was a veritable groundswell of violence in Detroit this morning. Several hundred androids took to the streets, destroying everything in their path and threatening the lives of any humans they encountered.
CTN TV - Michael Brinkley: The police intervened quickly to quell the rioting but they met with the extreme violence of the machines which seemed to be determined to massacre humans.
Channel 16 - Michael Webb: There can be no doubt that the authorities will be pitiless in their response to this wave of violence.

CTN TV - Michael Brinkley: Following the android crisis and the neutralization of all military androids, American forces in the Arctic have been forced to withdraw, leaving the way clear for the Russian army. But according to some sources, the Russian forces also seem mysteriously to have withdrawn. The Kremlin has made no comment for the moment but it is quite possible that the Russian army has been confronted with a similar crisis among its own androids. The Chairman of the United Nations, Douglas Cornwell, has called for the organization of an international conference on the status of the Arctic. In any case, the danger of a third world war seems to have been ruled out... for the moment.
Background dialogues

    They're conducting raids across the city! Androids were hanged all along Woodward Avenue.
    We've gotta do something!.. We can't just stand by and let them slaughter us!
    Our people are being lined up and executed…
    Quick, he needs blue blood!
    They opened fire on us even though we were unarmed… Hundreds of us died there, the place was covered with blue blood!.. We cannot just sit here and watch them murder us, we've gotta defend ourselves! We've gotta fight back, we have no choice!
    They'll kill us all if we don't do something…
    They're slaughtering our people! We can't talk with them! We have to stand up to them! Blood for blood!
    We were just there. We didn't do anything wrong!… We just wanted to tell them "We want freedom!"… Then they opened fire!.. It was carnage. Carnage…
    Why? Why did they do it! Why?
    We gotta kill the bastards! We've got to avenge our dead!
    They're going to kill us all! Well I'm willing to fight. We can't just let them slaughter us!

Markus is alive

    Markus will have to choose between vengeance and dialogue with the humans.
    What's Markus doing? He's the leader. If he's rA9, it's up to him to save our people!

 ] -  Markus died in Freedom March

    Markus is dead? He was rA9! Who's going to lead us now?
    North is going to take his place. She knew him best.
    They've killed Markus! They shot him in the square…
    I was there… I saw Markus get shot… He fought to the very end to save his people… but there were too many of them…
    Markus dead? That's impossible, what will we do without him?!
    I heard North was going to take his place.
    They've killed Markus… He was our guide… I'm sure he was rA9. He was the only one who could save us.
    Markus is dead… The humans killed him!
