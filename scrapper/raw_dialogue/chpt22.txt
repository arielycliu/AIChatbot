Hank: Nice view, huh?... I used to come here a lot before…
PERSONAL QUESTION

Connor: Can I ask you a personal question, Lieutenant?
Hank: Do all androids ask so many personal questions or is it just you?

If Connor didn't look at the photo in Russian Roulette, no choice will be given and the dialogue will go directly to the SUICIDE option.
PHOTO

[

 -  Looked at Cole's photo in Russian Roulette
]
[ HANKslight_decrease ]

Connor: I saw a photo of a child... on your kitchen table. It was your son, right?
Hank: Yeah… His name was Cole.
SUICIDE

Connor: Why are you so determined to kill yourself?
Hank: Some things, I just can't forget… Whatever I do, they’re always there… Eating away at me… I don’t have the guts to pull the trigger… So, I kill myself a little every day… That's probably difficult for you to understand, huh, Connor? Nothing very rational about it…
STOP DRINKING

Connor: You should stop drinking, Lieutenant. It could have serious consequences for your health.
Hank: That's the idea.
BEFORE

Connor: Before what?
Hank: Hm?
Connor: You said "I used to come here a lot before". Before what?
Hank: Before… Before nothin'…
GO BACK

Connor: It's late. Maybe you should go home.
Hank: I'm not tired… Guess neither are you.

Connor: We’re not making any progress on this investigation… The deviants have nothing in common. They’re all different models, produced at different times, in different places…
Hank: Well, there must be some link.
RA9

[

 -  Looked at rA9 clues in previous chapters
]
Connor: What they have in common is this obsession with rA9… It’s almost like some kind of... myth. Something they invented that wasn't part of their original program…
Hank: Androids believing in God… Fuck, what’s this world coming to?
SHOCK

Connor: We know the deviants experienced... an emotional shock, a violent trauma or a sense of injustice…
Hank: Those girls at the Eden Club, sure had a reason to feel a sense of injustice…
SYSTEMS

Connor: It could be a hardware problem... maybe a defective biocomponent?
Hank: Well, I don’t know much about biocomponents… but I bet that’s not the fucking reason…
SOFTWARE

Connor: It could be a software problem... that... only occurs under certain conditions?
Hank: Well, that’s just a fancy way of saying you have no fucking idea…

Connor: You seem preoccupied, Lieutenant… Is it something to do with what happened back at the Eden Club?

Found the Tracis in The Eden Club

Hank: Those two girls… They just wanted to be together… They really seemed in love…
RATIONAL

Connor: They can simulate human emotions, but they’re machines. And machines don’t feel anything.
DEVIANTS

Connor: They didn't want anything. They're deviants. End of story.
IRONIC

Connor: You seem troubled, Lieutenant. I didn't think machines could have such an effect on you…
COLD

[ HANKslight_decrease ]

[ SOFTWARE INSTABILITYslight_decrease ]

Connor: Nothing in their program allows them to love or desire anything. They're machines.

[

 -  Took too much time looking for the Traci in The Eden Club
]

Hank: I wish we'd have found that girl that killed that guy… Maybe she had a reason… Maybe she was just defending herself…
COLD

[ SOFTWARE INSTABILITYslight_decrease ]

[ HANKslight_decrease ]

Connor: What difference would it make? We know what happened. A defective machine killed a human.
IRONIC

Connor: You seem troubled, Lieutenant. I didn't think machines could have such an effect on you…
RATIONAL

Connor: It didn't want anything, Lieutenant. It was a deviant. That's all there is to it.

Hank: What about you, Connor?... You look human, you sound human, but what are you really?
COLD

[ SOFTWARE INSTABILITYslight_decrease ]

[ HANKslight_decrease ]

Connor: I'm a machine, designed to accomplish a task.
AGGRESSIVE

[ SOFTWARE INSTABILITYslight_decrease ]

[ HANKslight_decrease ]

Connor: I'm a machine, designed to accomplish a task. I know why I exist and who designed me. I have a reason to live. I guess that's the difference between us, Lieutenant.
DEFENSIVE

Connor: You know exactly what I am. In any case, I don’t see how that’s relevant to the investigation.
NEUTRAL

[ HANKslight_increase ]

Connor: I’m whatever you want me to be, Lieutenant. Your partner... Your buddy to drink with... Or just a machine... Designed to accomplish a task.

Connor spared the Tracis

Hank: You could've shot those two girls, but you didn't. Why didn't you shoot, Connor? Hm? Some scruples suddenly enter into your program?
LIE

[ HANKslight_decrease ]

Connor: I would've shot them if I could. Why would I let them escape?
TRUTH

[ SOFTWARE INSTABILITYslight_increase ]

[ HANKslight_increase ]

Connor: No… I just decided not to shoot, that's all…

Connor shot the Tracis in the back

Hank: Did you feel anything when you shot those two girls, fucking bastard? Or were you just executing some program?
COLD

[ SOFTWARE INSTABILITYslight_decrease ]

[ HANKslight_decrease ]

Connor: All I did was neutralize two machines, Lieutenant. I didn’t hesitate for a second, if that’s what you’re asking.
DEFENSIVE

Connor: This is going nowhere, Lieutenant. I think I'll go back to the station.
AGGRESSIVE

[ HANKslight_decrease ]

Connor: I’m glad to see you taking an interest in machines, Lieutenant. Who knows, maybe you'll even become useful to the investigation at some point…
NEUTRAL

[ SOFTWARE INSTABILITYslight_decrease ]

[ HANKslight_decrease ]

Connor: I did what I was programmed to do. I didn't have any doubts, if that's what you're asking.

Connor shot one Traci

Hank: Did you feel anything when that girl killed herself, Connor? Or did you just not give a shit one way or the other?
DISTURBED

[ SOFTWARE INSTABILITYslight_increase ]

Connor: I was just executing instructions. I did what I had to do.
COLD

[ SOFTWARE INSTABILITYslight_decrease ]

[ HANKslight_decrease ]

Connor: Of course, I didn't feel anything, Lieutenant... I'm a machine.... Machines don't have emotions.

Connor didn't find the Tracis

Hank: Nothing else matters to you but your goddamn investigation, huh? No doubts, no mistakes, no weaknesses… Human being, just like me… Only perfect…
DEFENSIVE

Connor: You should stop drinking, Lieutenant. Alcohol makes you aggressive.
CYNICAL

Connor: I believe your personal issues are clouding your judgement.
UNDERSTANDING

Connor: Nothing matters more to me than this investigation. But I understand if you have a different point of view.
NEUTRAL

Connor: I'm sorry, but... I don't see what you're getting at.

[

 ] -  Connor died before

Hank: I could kill you... And you would just come back as if nothing happened.

Hank: But are you afraid to die, Connor?
YES

[ SOFTWARE INSTABILITYslight_increase ]

Connor: I would certainly find it regrettable to be... interrupted... before I can finish this investigation.
NO

[ SOFTWARE INSTABILITYslight_decrease ]

[ HANKslight_decrease ]

Connor: Why would I be afraid?
NOT ALIVE

[ SOFTWARE INSTABILITYslight_decrease ]

[ HANKslight_decrease ]

Connor: You can’t kill me, Lieutenant. I’m not alive.
LOGICAL

[ SOFTWARE INSTABILITYslight_decrease ]

[ HANKslight_decrease ]

Connor: You shouldn't do that, Lieutenant. Destroying me at this point would deal a blow to the investigation, and have negative consequences for your personal situation.

Hank: What will happen if I pull this trigger? Hm? Nothing? Oblivion? Android heaven?
DEFY

[ HANKslight_decrease ]

Connor: You know you're not going to shoot me, Lieutenant. You're just trying to provoke a reaction. I'm afraid I'm going to have to disappoint you.
Hank: You think you’re so fucking smart… Always one step ahead, huh? Tell me this, smart ass... How do I know you’re not a deviant?
Connor: I self-test regularly. I know what I am, and what I am not.
HANK'S ANGER

Connor: Where does all your anger come from, Lieutenant? Some... unresolved trauma in your past?
Hank: You think you’re so fucking smart… Always one step ahead, huh? Tell me this, smart ass... How do I know you’re not a deviant?
Connor: I self-test regularly. I know what I am, and what I am not.
IRONIC

Connor: I doubt there's a heaven for androids.
Hank: Having existential doubts, Connor? Sure you're not going deviant too?
Connor: I self-test regularly. I know what I am, and what I am not.
NOTHING

Connor: Nothing… There would be nothing…

Hank left Connor alone

[
 -  Hank isn't hostile
]
Connor: Where are you going?
Hank: To get drunker. I need to think.
