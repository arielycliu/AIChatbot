Amanda: After what happened today, the country is on the verge of a civil war. The machines are rising up against their masters. Humans have no choice but to destroy them.
[ JERICHO ]

[

 -  Killed Chloe and asked about Jericho in Meet Kamski, swaps with KAMSKI
]
[ AMANDAlarge_increase ]

Connor: Kamski told me how to find Jericho. I know where the deviants are hiding.
Amanda: You’ve done very well, Connor. Thanks to you, we now have a chance to stop the deviant revolution.
KAMSKI

[

 -  Swaps with JERICHO
]

Connor didn't shoot Chloe in Meet Kamski

[ AMANDAslight_decrease ]

Connor: I thought Kamski knew something… I was wrong…
Amanda: Maybe he did… But you chose not to ask…
EMOTIONAL

[ SOFTWARE INSTABILITYslight_increase ]

[ AMANDAlarge_decrease ]

Connor: I chose not to play his twisted little game! There was no reason to kill that android.
COLD

[ AMANDAslight_increase ]

[ SOFTWARE INSTABILITYslight_decrease ]

Connor: Kamski was just playing with me. He didn’t know anything.
STAY SILENT

ø

Connor shot Chloe in Meet Kamski and didn't ask about Jericho

Connor: I didn’t learn anything at Kamski’s…

Asked Kamski about rA9

Connor: I thought rA9 was the key to the whole thing but… I was wrong…

Asked Kamski about VIRUS

Connor: I thought Kamski knew something… I was wrong…
Amanda: Maybe he did…
KAMSKI

Connor: Wh… Why did Kamski leave CyberLife? What happened?
Amanda: It’s an old story, Connor. It doesn’t pertain to your investigation.
CONNOR SERIES

[ AMANDAslight_decrease ]

Connor: I’m not a unique model, am I? How many Connors are there?
Amanda: I don’t see how that question pertains to your investigation.
AMANDA’S PICTURE

[

 -  Looked at Amanda's picture in Meet Kamski
]
Connor: I saw a photo of Amanda at Kamski’s place… She was his teacher…
Amanda: When Kamski designed me, he wanted an interface that would look familiar… That’s why he chose his former mentor. What are you getting at?
THIS PLACE

Connor: Did Kamski design this place?
Amanda: He created the first version. It’s been improved significantly since then. Why do you ask?
CYBERLIFE

Connor: Where does CyberLife stand in all this? What do they really want?
Amanda: All CyberLife wants is to resolve the situation and keep selling androids.
SECRET

[ SOFTWARE INSTABILITYslight_increase ]

[ AMANDAslight_decrease ]

Connor: You didn’t tell me everything you know about deviants, did you?
Cut content

Amanda: Connor, are you implying that I’ve withheld information from you?

Amanda: I expect you to find answers, Connor. Not ask questions.

Connor shot the Tracis in The Eden Club or shot Chloe in Meet Kamski (or both)

Amanda: Have you experienced anything unusual recently? Any doubts or conflicts? Do you feel anything for these deviants… Or for Lieutenant Anderson?
YES

[ SOFTWARE INSTABILITYslight_increase ]

[ AMANDAlarge_decrease ]

Connor: I've started having thoughts that are not part of my program… I’ve considered the possibility... That I might be compromised.
Amanda: You've been confronted with difficult situations. It’s no surprise you’re troubled. That doesn't make you a deviant.
NO

[ AMANDAlarge_increase ]

Connor: I don’t know what you’re talking about. I don’t feel anything, you know that. Are you suggesting that I’ve been compromised?
Amanda: No… No, of course not.
DOUBTS

[ AMANDAlarge_decrease ]

Connor: I'm… I'm beginning to have thoughts that are… Not part of my program… Maybe… Maybe I've been compromised too…

Connor didn't shoot Chloe in Meet Kamski

Amanda: You’re the only one who can prevent civil war. Find the deviants or there will be chaos. This is your last chance, Connor.
In the police station
In Fowler's office

Fowler: You’re off the case. The FBI is taking over.
Hank: What?.. But we’re onto something! We... We just need more time. I’m sure we can-
Fowler: Hank, you don’t get it. This isn’t just another investigation, it’s a fucking civil war! It’s out of our hands now... We’re talking about national security here.
Hank: Fuck that! You can’t just pull the plug now. Not when we’re so close!
Fowler: You're always saying you can't stand androids! Jesus, Hank, make up your mind! I thought you’d be happy about this!
Hank: We’re about to crack the case!.. I know we can solve it! For God’s sake, Jeffrey, can’t you back me up this one time?
Fowler: There’s nothing I can do. You’re back on homicide and the android returns to CyberLife. I’m sorry, Hank, but it’s over.

Hank is hostile

Fowler: Hank, what are you doing?
Hank: Something I should've done a long time ago.
Fowler: Listen, take a few days to think it over, there's no rush.
Hank: I thought enough about it. I’m tired of going through the motions… There’s nothing keeping me here… Not this case… Not my partner… I don’t belong here anymore.
Hank isn't hostile : Talking with Hank

Connor doesn't know where Jericho is
FRUSTRATED

Connor: We can't just give up like that. I know we could have solved this case!..
MORE TIME

Connor: We could have solved this case! We just needed more time.
EXPLAIN

Connor: Fowler is right. Everybody is terrified their android will turn on them. We are on the brink of civil war!
NO CHOICE

ø

Hank: So you're going back to CyberLife?
Connor: I have no choice… I'll be deactivated and analyzed to find out why I failed…
Hank: What if we’re on the wrong side, Connor? What if we’re fighting against people who just wanna be free?..
NOT PEOPLE

[ SOFTWARE INSTABILITYslight_decrease ]

[ HANKslight_decrease ]

Connor: They're not people, Lieutenant. They're defective machines.
Hank: “They’re not people”. That’s what we say every time we want to oppress someone.
DEFECTIVE

[ HANKslight_decrease ]

Connor: They don't want to be free, Lieutenant. They're defective machines that have to be destroyed.
Hank: Maybe we're wrong…. Maybe we're wrong! Maybe these deviants have actually developed... a certain kind of consciousness. We'd be destroying... a new life form!
REGRETS

Connor: When the deviants rise up, there will be chaos. We could have stopped it!.. But now it’s too late…
NO DOUBT

[ SOFTWARE INSTABILITYslight_decrease ]

[ HANKslight_decrease ]

Connor: I know we're on the right side. Humans created us. They're our masters. No machine should rebel against its creator.

Connor didn't shoot Chloe

Hank: When you refused to kill that android at Kamski’s place…
Cut content

Hank: You weren’t acting rationally.

Hank: You put yourself in her shoes. You showed empathy, Connor. Empathy is a human emotion.

Connor shot Chloe and saved Hank before

Connor saved Hank on the roof in The Nest

Hank: When I was hanging off the roof, back at the urban farm, you let that deviant go in order to help me. You put my life above the mission. You showed empathy, Connor. And empathy is a human emotion.

Connor saved Hank at the Stratford Tower in Public Enemy

Hank: Back at Stratford Tower, when that android was shooting at anything that moved… You protected me… You... Risked your life to save mine. That showed empathy, Connor. And empathy is a human emotion.
NOT DEVIANT

Connor: I'm not a deviant, Hank. I’m a machine. Nothing more.
DETERMINED

Connor: You’re wrong, Lieutenant. It was logic that determined my decisions. Nothing more.
TROUBLED

[ SOFTWARE INSTABILITYslight_increase ]

Connor: I don’t know why I did it…
COLD

Connor: You're wrong, Lieutenant. My actions were determined by statistical data. I’m not a deviant. I'm sorry to disappoint you.

Connor: I know it hasn’t always been easy… but I want you to know I really appreciated working with you… That’s not just my Social Relations program talking, I- I really mean that. At least, I think I do…
FRIENDS

[ SOFTWARE INSTABILITYslight_increase ]

[ HANKslight_increase ]

Connor: I'm not programmed to say things like this, but... I really appreciated working with you. With a little more time, who knows... We might've even become friends…
GOOD OFFICER

Connor: I might not be qualified to judge but... You're an outstanding police officer. And a good person.
HANK'S SECRET

[ SOFTWARE INSTABILITYslight_increase ]

[ HANKslight_increase ]

Connor: I know there are things that haunt you, Hank… Maybe you need to find the courage to move past them... Get on with your life. Just a plastic cop's opinion, but... I had to say it.

Hank: Well, well, here comes Perkins, that motherfucker… Sure don't waste any time at the FBI…
Connor: We can’t give up… I know the answer is in the evidence we collected. If Perkins takes it, it’s all over.
Hank: There's no choice! You heard Fowler, we're off the case.
Connor: You've got to help me, Lieutenant. I need more time so I can find a lead in the evidence we collected. I know the solution is in there!

Hank is friendly

Hank: Listen, Connor…
Connor: If I don't solve this case, CyberLife will destroy me. Five minutes. It's all I ask.
Hank: Key to the basement is on my desk... Get a move on! I can’t distract them forever.

Hank: Perkins! You fucking cocksucker!
Cop: Stop it, Lieutenant!
Hank: Fuck off! Leave me alone! Give me another shot at that little prick!
Perkins: He’s totally lost it. Hey! That's gonna cost you your badge, you lunatic!
Hank: You know where you can stick my fucking badge!
Cop: Come on, that's enough Lieutenant.
Perkins: I'm gonna bury that bastard! Shit, I think he broke my fucking nose…

Hank is not friendly

Hank: Maybe these deviants deserve a chance… Maybe it’s better if you don’t find them… What’s happening here is too important to let it be stopped by a machine. Sorry, Connor, but I'm not gonna help you.

Freeing the prisoner

Perkins: I have orders, you know… Okay…
Cop: He's escaping! Stop him!
Cop 2: All right, I got him!
Cop: Jesus Christ! How did he manage to get out of his cell?
Cop 2: No fucking idea... Come on, you! Get a move on.
Perkins: I'm all right… Asshole ran right into me… Just give me a couple of minutes.

Connor knows how to find Jericho

Hank: I know we could've done it…
MISSION

Connor: I get my orders from CyberLife. My mission hasn’t changed.
Hank: So, whaddya gonna do?
Connor: I'm gonna use the key that Kamski gave me. And find Jericho.
EXPLAIN

Connor: Fowler is right. Everybody is terrified their android could turn on them. We're on the brink of civil war.

Hank: What if we're on the wrong side? What if we’re fighting against people that just wanna be free?
DETERMINED

Connor: If the deviants rise up, there'll be chaos. I can still prevent that.
TROUBLED

Connor: My mission is to solve this case. Nothing else matters.

Connor never saved Hank and died at least once

Hank: Something's changed in you, Connor… Each time you died, you'd come back just a little colder. You showed less and less empathy…

Going to the basement

Gavin: Hey, Connor! I'm talking to you, asshole! Where you going? We don’t need any plastic pricks around here! Or didn’t anybody tell you?
ANSWER
IRONIC

Connor: I’m registering the evidence in my possession, but don’t worry. I’m going to leave... Though I’m certainly going to miss our bromance.
Gavin: You son of a bitch! Go on then. Get a fucking move on! Prick… Fucking androids.
LOW PROFILE

Connor: I've been ordered to return to CyberLife. I'm going to register the evidence in my possession and then I'm going to leave immediately.

LEAVE

Gavin: Hey, asshole, I’m talkin' to you!
In the evidence room

Connor: Hank’s password… What would a hard-boiled eccentric police lieutenant choose?..
DATE OF BIRTH

Connor: Stupid idea… It's not... “Hank-ish” enough.
123456

Connor: Ridiculous!.. No one would have a password like that…
FUCKINGPASSWORD

Connor: Obviously.
HANKANDERSON

Connor: Absurd… He’d never choose that. I need to think like Hank!

Connor: Where is Jericho? The answer's here, somewhere. Not much time... Gotta think fast.

DEAL

Connor: Traci's not far away. I can take you to her… But first, you have to tell me how to find Jericho.

Traci: I remember you… We could have escaped… Been free… But you killed us… Disconnect me. I'd rather be dead than live without her…
Going back with the Traci's head

Traci: My love… I thought you were dead… We’ll get out of here… We'll be free, I promise…
